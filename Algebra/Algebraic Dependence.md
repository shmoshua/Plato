> [!definition]
> Let $L:K$ be a [[field extension]] and $B\subseteq L$. Let $K(B)$ be the smallest subfield containing $K$ and $B$. 
> 1. $B$ is called ***algebraically dependent*** over $K$, if there is non-zero polynomial $f\in K[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]$ with $f(b_{1},\dots,b_{n})=0$ for some distinct $b_{1},\dots,b_{n}\in B$. 
> 2. $B$ is called ***algebraically independent*** if it's not algebraically dependent.
> 3. $B$ is called a ***transcendence basis*** of $L$ over $K$ if it is algebraically independent and $L$ is algebraic over $K(B)$.
