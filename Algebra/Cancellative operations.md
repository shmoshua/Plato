> A binary operation $\cdot$ on a set $S$ is ***left-cancellative*** if whenever $x,y,z\in S$ and $xy=xz$, we have $y=z$. Further, $S$ is ***cancellative***, if it's both left- and right-cancellative.

- If an operation is commutative, one-side cancellativity implies the other side as well!
- However, cancellativity does not imply commutativity.
