##### Subgroups of $C$
As the top surface and front surface uniquely defines a cube, we have $6\cdot 4=24$ elements in $C$. This means that the possible orders of subgroups are $\{1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24\}$. We have:
- Subgroup of order $1$: $\{ \text{id} \}$.
- Subgroup of order $2$: 


**Example**: Subgroups of $C$ (dice group)
- $|C|=24$.
- Possible orders of subgroups of $C$ are: $\{1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24\}$. Then, we have:
	- $|\{ e \}|=1$.
	- $|C|=24$.
	- $|C_{2}|=2$.
	- $|C_{3}|=3$.
	- $|C_{2}\times C_{2}|=4$. 
	- $D_{3}$ with $6$ elements.
	- $D_{4}$ for $8$.

- The tetrahedron group $T \unlhd C$. Then, $[C : T]=2$ and therefore, $C / T\cong C_{2}$. 
- For the group $N:=C_{2}\times C_{2} \unlhd C$, then $[N:C]=6$. As $C$ doesn't have an element of order $6$, it cannot be isomorphic to $C_{6}$ and we have $N / C\cong D_{3}$.
