> [!definition]
> Let $R_{1},\dots,R_{n}$ be [[Ring|rings]]. The ***direct sum*** $R_{1}\oplus\dots \oplus R_{n}$ is the set $R_{1}\times\dots \times R_{n}$ with component-wise addition and multiplication. Then, 
> 1. $0=(0_1,\dots,0_{n})$ and 
> 2. $1=(1_{1},\dots,1_{n})$

- **Remark**: The direct sum $R_{1}\oplus\dots \oplus R_{n}$ is also a ring.

##### Examples
- $\mathbb{R}\oplus \mathbb{R}$ is a ring, but not a [[Field|field]], as $(0,1)(1,0)=(0,0)$.
