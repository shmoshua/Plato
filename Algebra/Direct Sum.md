> Let $M$ be an $R$-[[module]]. 
> 1. The ***internal direct sum***  $M_{1}\oplus\dots \oplus M_{n}$ of [[Submodule|submodules]] $M_{1},\dots,M_{n}$ of $M$ is the set $M_{1}\times\dots \times M_{n}$ with component-wise addition and multiplication given by the bijective map: $$\pi:M_{1}\oplus \dots \oplus M_{n}\to M_{1}+\dots+M_{n},\quad (m_{1},\dots,m_{n})\mapsto m_{1}\dots m_{n}$$
> 2. The ***external direct sum*** of a collection $M_{1},\dots,M_{n}$ of $R$-modules, $M_{1}\times\dots \times M_{n}$ with component-wise addition and multiplication is the

- **Remark**: The direct sum $R_{1}\oplus\dots \oplus R_{n}$ is also a ring.

##### Examples
- $\mathbb{R}\oplus \mathbb{R}$ is a ring, but not a [[Field|field]], as $(0,1)(1,0)=(0,0)$.
