> [!lemma] Proposition 1
> $A_{5}\cong D$ is [[Simple Group|simple]], i.e. $A_{5}$ has no non-trivial normal subgroups.

> [!proof]-
> We look at the rotations of $D$. $$\begin{array}{ccc}&\textsf{Type}&\textsf{Number}\\1&\textsf{Rotation of order }1&1\\15&\textsf{Rotation of order }2&15\\10&\textsf{Rotation of order }3&20\\6&\textsf{Rotation of order }5&24\\\end{array}$$
> If a normal subgroup $N \unlhd D$ has a rotation of order $>1$, then it has every rotation of the same order. Therefore, $\left| N \right|=16,21,25,\geq 36$. But as none of these numbers divide $60$, we have that $A_{5}$ is simple.
