> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> For a field $F$, 
> 1. any finite subgroup $G\leq F^{*}$ is [[Cyclic Groups|cyclic]].
> 2. if $F$ is finite, $F^{*}$ is cyclic.

> [!proof]-
> Let $n=e(G)$, the [[Exponent of a Group|exponent]] of $G$. Then, $\alpha^n=1$ for all $\alpha\in G$. Since $x^n-1$ has at most $n$ roots, $\left| G \right|\leq n$. But $n=e(G)\leq \left| G \right|$. However, by [[Exponent of a Group|Theorem 1]], there exists $g\in G$ with $\text{ord}(g)=e(G)$. This proves that $G$ is cyclic.
