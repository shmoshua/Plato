> [!definition]
> Let $S$ be a set s.t. every $s\in S$ has an inverse $s ^{-1}$. Then, 
> 1. a ***word*** $w$ is a finite sequence $w=(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\subseteq S\cup S^{-1}$.
> 2. a word $w$ is ***reduced*** if there exists no $i$ s.t. $x_{i}=x_{i+1}^{-1}$.
> 
> Then, the ***free group*** $F_{S}$ generated by $S$ is the group of all ***reduced words*** generated by $S$ with group operation as concatenation (with reduction).
