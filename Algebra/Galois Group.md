> [!definition]
> Let $K$ be a [[Field|subfield]] of $L$. An [[Ring Homomorphism|automorphism]] $\sigma\in \text{Aut}(L)$ is called a ***$K$-automorphism*** of $L$ is $$\sigma|_{F}=\text{id}_{F}$$Then, 
> 1. the ***Galois group  of $L:K$*** is the group of all $K$-automorphism of $L$, denotes as $\text{Gal}(L / K)$ or $\text{Aut}_{K}L$.
> 2. the ***Galois group of $f\in K[X]$*** is $\text{Gal}(L / K)$ where $L$ is the splitting field of $f$ over $K$.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> For a field extension $L:K$, the set of all $K$-automorphisms of $L$ forms a group with composition.
