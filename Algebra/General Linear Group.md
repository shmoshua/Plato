> [!definition]
> The ***general linear group*** for $n\in \mathbb{N}$, denoted as $(\text{GL}(n),\cdot)$ is defined as: $$\text{GL}(n):=\{  A\in \text{M}(n):\det(A)\neq 0 \}$$
> where $\text{M}(n)$ is the set of all $n\times n$ matrices with real numbers as entries.

- $\text{GL}(1)\cong (\mathbb{R}^*,\cdot)$ which means $\text{GL}(1)$ is abelian.
- For $n>1$, $\text{GL}(n)$ is non-abelian as matrix multiplications don't commute.
