#Definition #Algebra 

> [!definition]
> Let $A,B$ be two [[Group|groups]]. A group $G$ is the group extension, if there exist a [[Exact Sequence|SES]]: $$0\to A\hookrightarrow G\twoheadrightarrow B\to 0$$
---
##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1 (Normal subgroups)
> Let $G$ be a group and $N\unlhd G$. Then, 
> 1. $G$ is the extension of $N$ and $G / N$. 
---
> [!h] Example 2 (Solvable groups)
> [[Solvable Group|Solvable groups]] are extensions of abelian groups.
