> Let $H \leq \text{SO}(3)$ is a subgroup generated by rotations $\varphi,\psi$ where: 
> 1. $\varphi$ is the rotation around the axis $(0,0,0)-(1,0,1)$ by $\pi$, i.e. $$\varphi=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&1\\0&-1&0\\1&0&0\end{bmatrix}$$
> 2. $\psi$ is the rotation around the $z$-axis by $\frac{2\pi}{3}$, i.e. $$\psi=-\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}-1&-\sqrt{ 3 }&0\\\sqrt{ 3}&-1&0\\ 0&0&2\end{bmatrix}$$

> Further, we also define $S^2$, the set of 2-sphere, i.e. the surface of the ball with radius 1 and middle point in the origin in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
> 
> We have:
> 1. $\varphi^{2} = \iota=\psi^3$
> 2. $\varphi^{-1}=\varphi$
> 3. $\psi^{-1}=\psi^{2}$
> 4. Every element $\rho\in H$ can be written as $$\rho=\varphi^{\varepsilon_{0}}(\psi^{\varepsilon_{1}}\varphi \cdots \psi^{\varepsilon_{n}}\varphi)\psi^{\varepsilon_{n+1}}$$ where $\varepsilon_{i}\in \{ 1,-1 \}$ for $i\in[n+1]$ and $\varepsilon_{0}\in \{ 0,1 \}$. Then, these rotations are all pairwise different, especially from $\iota$.

> Now, let's consider the [[Cayley graph]] of $H$. Then, there exists exactly one finite path from $\iota$ to any $\rho\in H$. We now introduce a $3$-coloring on the graph. To every $\varphi$-edge, we have 1 on one side, for every $\psi$-triangle, we have: 
> $$1\xrightarrow{\psi}2\xrightarrow{\psi}3$$

##### Group Operation on 2-Sphere
Now consider $H \curvearrowright S^{2}$. Then, the points on $S^{2}$ decompose into pairwise disjoint [[Orbit and Stablizer|orbits]]. Per definition of $H$, we know that every orbit is countable. This means, we have an uncountable number of orbits.

We will call a point $x\in S^{2}$ a (local) fixed point, if there exists a rotation $\rho \in H$ s.t. $\rho x=x$. It holds that every point $x\in S^{2}$ in an orbit of a fixed point is a fixed point itself. Let $y\in S^{2}$ be a fixed point with $\rho y = y$ for $\rho\in H$. If $x\in[y]$ where $\rho y = y$ for $\rho\in H$, $\rho \neq \iota$, then there exists $\sigma\in H$ with $x=\sigma y$. Then, 
$$(\sigma \rho \sigma^{-1})(x)=\sigma y = x$$Therefore, $x$ is a fixed point of $\sigma \rho \sigma^{-1}$.

Let $F \subseteq S^{2}$ be a countable set of fixed points and $S^{2*}:= S^{2} \backslash F$. Then, it holds for all $x\in S^{2*}$ and $\rho\in H$, $\rho \neq \iota$: $$\rho x \neq x$$

Now, let $O:= \{ [x]: x\in S^{2*} \}$, i.e. $O = S^{2*}/H$, the set of orbits of elements from $x\in S^{2*}$. With [[Axiom of Choice]], we can choose an element from every orbit in $O$ into a set $M$. Then, the points $x\in S^{2*}$ can be marked with $1/2/3$; every point from $M$ gets 1; if $x\in S^{2*}$, then there exists exactly one $y\in M$ and $\rho_{x}\in H$ s.t. $\rho_{x}y=x$. Then, $x$ can be marked by the mark of $\rho_{x}$ in the Cayley graph.

Finally, let: 
1. $A:= \{ x\in S^{2*} : x \text{ is marked with }1 \}$
2. $B:= \{ x\in S^{2*} : x \text{ is marked with }2 \}$
3. $C:= \{ x\in S^{2*} : x \text{ is marked with }3 \}$

Then, $S^{2}=A \cup B \cup C \cup F$ where $A,B,C,F$ are pairwise disjoint and $F$ is countable. Further, $B = \psi[A]$ and $C = \psi^{-1}[A]$. Moreover, $B \cup C = \varphi[A]$. This means that: 
1. $A \cong B \cong C$
2. $A \cong B \cup C$
   
Therefore, from $S^{2*}$ we can generate two $S^{2*}$s, which only lack a countable number of points.
