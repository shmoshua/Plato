> Two groups $(G_{1},\circ)$ and $(G_{2},\bullet)$ are ***isomorphic***,i.e. $G_{1}\cong G_{2}$,  if there exists a bijection $\varphi:G_{1}\to G_{2}$ s.t. for all $x,y\in G_{1}$ we have: $$\varphi(x\circ y)=\varphi(x)\bullet \varphi(y)$$
> Then, the mapping $\varphi$ is called an ***isomorphism***.
- All groups with 1 element are isomorphic.
