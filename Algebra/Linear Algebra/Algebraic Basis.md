#Definition #LST #LinearAlgebra 

> [!definition]
> Let $V$ be a $\mathbb{K}$-[[Vector Space|linear space]]. A set of vectors $S \subseteq V$ is an ***(algebraic) basis*** of $(V,F)$ if and only if they are [[Linear Independence|linearly independent ]] and [[Span|spans]] $V$, i.e. $\text{Span}(S)=V$.

##### Properties

> [!lemma] Fact Basis.1
> Let $(V,F)$ be a linear space. If a basis of $(V,F)$ exists with a finite number of elements, then every other basis of $(V,F)$ has the same number of elements.

> [!proof]- Proof (Incomplete)
> Consider two bases of $(V,F)$, $S$ and $S'$ and assume that $S$ has a finite number of elements $\{ v_{i} \}_{i=1}^n$. Assume that, however, we have a different number of elements in $S'$. We can assume wlog that $|S'|>n$.
