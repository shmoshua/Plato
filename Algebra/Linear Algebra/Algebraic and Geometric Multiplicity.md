> [!definition]
> For a matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n,n}$ and an [[Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] $\lambda\in \mathbb{C}$, 
> 1. the ***algebraic multiplicity*** of $\lambda$ is the number of times $\lambda$ appears in the [[Algebra/Linear Algebra/Spectrum|spectrum]] of $A$.
> 2. the ***geometric multiplicity*** of $\lambda$ is the dimension of $\text{ker}(A-\lambda I)$
