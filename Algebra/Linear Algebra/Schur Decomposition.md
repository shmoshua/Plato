> [!definition]
> A square matrix $A\in \mathbb{C}^{n,n}$ has a **Schur decomposition** of the following form $$A=QUQ^{-1}$$
> where $Q$ is a [[unitary matrix]] and $U$ is an upper-triangular matrix. Then, due to the similarity between $A$ and $U$, and the fact that $U$ is triangular, the eigenvalues of $A$ are the diagonal entries of $U$.
