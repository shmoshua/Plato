> [!definition]
> For a [[Vector Space| linear space]] $(V,F)$ and $S\subseteq V$. The ***span*** of $S$ is the set defined as:
> $$\text{Span}(S):=\left\{  \left. \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}v_{i} \right| n\in \mathbb{N},a_{i}\in F,v_{i}\in S,i\in [n]   \right\}$$
> i.e. it is the set of all [[Linear Combinations | linear combinations]] of vectors of $S$.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Lemma Span.1
> Let $(V,F)$ be a linear space and $S \subseteq V$. The [[Vector Subspace| linear subspace]] generated by $S$ coincides with $\text{Span}(S)$.

> [!proof]-
> The fact that $\text{Span}(S)$ is a subspace and contains $S$ is easy to check. To show that it is the smallest subspace containing $S$, consider $W$ that contains $S$ and an arbitrary $v\in \text{Span}(S)$. We will show that $v\in W$. Since $v\in \text{Span}(S)$, it can be written as: $$v=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}v_{i}$$
> for some $n\in \mathbb{N},a_{i}\in F,v_{i}\in S, i\in[n]$. As $v_{i}\in W$ for all $i$ and $W$ is a subspace, $v\in W$.
