> [!definition]
> The ***spectrum*** of a matrix $A\in F^{n,n}$ is the list of [[Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of $A$, denoted by $\text{Spec}(A)=\{ \lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{n} \}$

##### Properties

> [!lemma] Theorem Spect.1
> A matrix $A\in F^{n,n}$ is invertible if and only if $0\in F$ is not in the spectrum $\text{Spec}(A)$.

> [!proof]-
> $0\in F$ is not in the spectrum if and only if $\text{Null}(\mathcal{A})=\{ \theta \}$, i.e. $\text{Nullity}(A)=0$. This is the case if and only if $A$ is invertible.
