##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1 (Nakayama)
> Let $R$ be a local ring and $M$ a finitely generated module over $R$. 
> 1. if there is a proper ideal $I\unlhd R$ with $IM=M$, then $M=0$.
> 2. if $I\unlhd R$ is the unique maximal ideal and $m_{1},\dots,m_{k}\in M$ s.t. $\overline{m_{1}},\dots,\overline{m_{k}}$ generate $M / IM$ as a $R / I$-vector space. Then, $m_{1},\dots,m_{k}$ generate $M$ as an $R$-module.

> [!proof]-
> We have that:
> 1. By [[Maximal Ideal|Theorem 2]], $I$ is contained in some maximal ideal $J$ and as $R$ is local, $J$ is unique. Further, we have that $JM=M$. Hence, by [[Module|Nakayama]], there exists an element $a\in J$ with $am=m$ for all $m\in M$.
>    
>    Now, we claim that $1-a$ is a unit. Otherwise, $(1-a)$ is a proper ideal contained in $J$. But, then $1-a$ and $a$ are both in $J$ and $1\in J$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $(1-a)m=0$ for all $m\in M$ and this is only possible if $M=0$.
> 2. Let $N$ be the $R$-module generated by $m_{1},\dots,m_{k}$. Then, $N+IM=M$. Now, $$M / N=(N+IM) / N\cong IM / (IM\cap N)\cong I(M / N)$$Hence, by 1, $M / N=0$ and $M=N$.

##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1
> Let $P\unlhd R$ be prime. Then, 
> 1. $R_{P}$ is local with maximal ideal $P^e:=\left\{  \frac{a}{s}:a\in R,s\notin P  \right\}$

> [!proof]-
> We use [[Localization|Proposition 2]]. Notice that any prime ideal of $R$ contained in $P$ is upperbounded by $P$. Hence, by the correspondence, $P^e$ is the upper bound of every prime ideal in $R_{P}$. In particular, every maximal ideal has to be contained in $P^e$, which means there can only be one.
