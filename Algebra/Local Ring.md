> [!definition]
> A commutative [[ring]] is called ***local*** if it has only one [[maximal ideal]].

##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1
> Let $P\unlhd R$ be prime. Then, 
> 1. $R_{P}$ is local with maximal ideal $P^e:=\left\{  \frac{a}{s}:a\in R,s\notin P  \right\}$

> [!proof]-
> We use [[Localization|Proposition 2]]. Notice that any prime ideal of $R$ contained in $P$ is upperbounded by $P$. Hence, by the correspondence, $P^e$ is the upper bound of every prime ideal in $R_{P}$. In particular, every maximal ideal has to be contained in $P^e$, which means there can only be one.
