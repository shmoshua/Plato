> Let $R$ be a commutative [[ring]].
> 1. A subset $S\subseteq R$ is called ***multiplicatively closed***, if $1\in S$ and $ab\in S$ for all $a,b\in S$. 
> 2. For a multiplicatively closed set $S\subseteq R$, the ***localization of $R$ at $S$*** is given by the ring: $$S^{-1}R:= (R\times S) / {\sim}$$where $(a,s)\sim(a',s')$ if and only if there exists $u\in S$ s.t. $u(as'-a's)=0$ where $\frac{a}{s}:=[(a,s)]$. The addition and multiplication are given by: $$\frac{a}{s}+\frac{a'}{s}=$$
