##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> Let $L:K$ be an extension. Then, the following are equivalent:
> 1. $L:K$ is normal and $[L:K]<+\infty$
> 2. $L$ is a [[splitting field]] of some polynomial $f\in K[X]$

> [!proof]-
> Let $L$ be a splitting field of $g\in K[X]$. Let further $f\in K[X]$ with a root $\alpha\in L$. We need to show that $f$ splits in $L$. Let $M$ be the splitting field of $f\cdot g$. Suppose $\theta_{1},\theta_{2}$ are 2 roots of $f$ in $M$.
> 
> For $j=1,2$, we have that: $$[L(\theta_{j}):L][L:K]=[L(\theta_{j}):K]=[L(\theta_{j}):K(\theta_{j})][K(\theta_{j}):K]$$Since $\theta_{1},\theta_{2}$ are roots of the same irreducible polynomial, $K(\theta_{1})\cong K(\theta_{2})$ and especially, $$[K(\theta_{1}):K]=[K(\theta_{2}):K]$$As $L$ is a splitting field of $g$ over $K$, $L(\theta_{j})$ is a splitting field of $g$ over $K(\theta_{j})$. Therefore, by [[Splitting Field|Theorem 2]], the isomorphism $\varphi:K(\theta_{1})\to K(\theta_{2})$ can be extended to $\sigma:L(\theta_{1})\to L(\theta_{2})$ and in particular, $$[L(\theta_{1}):K(\theta_{1})]=[L(\theta_{2}):K(\theta_{2})]$$Therefore, $$[L(\theta_{1}):L]=\frac{[L(\theta_{1}):K(\theta_{1})][K(\theta_{1}):K]}{[L:K]}=\frac{[L(\theta_{2}):K(\theta_{2})][K(\theta_{2}):K]}{[L:K]}=[L(\theta_{2}):L]$$However, as $\alpha\in L$, it follows that for any other root $\theta$ of $f$, $$[L(\theta):L]=[L(\alpha):L]=1$$Therefore, $\theta\in L$ and $L:K$ is normal and finite by [[Splitting Field|Theorem 1]].
> 
> Conversely, assume $L:K$ is normal and finite, i.e. $L=K(\alpha_{1},\dots,\alpha_{n})$ for some $\alpha_{i}\in L$. Then, consider: $$f:=m_{\alpha_{1},K}\cdot \dots \cdot m_{\alpha_{n},K}$$As each $m_{\alpha_{i},K}$ is irreducible and $\alpha_{i}\in L$, it splits in $L$ and consequently, $f$ splits in $L$. Since $L$ is generated by $K$ and the roots of $f$, it is the splitting field of $f$ over $K$.
