Types:  [[Special Orthogonal Groups]]

> [!definition]
> The ***orthogonal group*** for $n\in \mathbb{N}$, denoted as $(\text{O}(n),\cdot)$ is defined as: $$\text{O}(n):=\{  A\in \text{M}(n):A A^\top=I_{n} \}$$
> where $\text{M}(n)$ is the set of all $n\times n$ matrices with real numbers as entries.

- $\text{O}(1)\cong (\{-1, 1 \},\cdot)$ which means $\text{O}(1)$ is abelian.
- For $n>1$, $\text{O}(n)$ is non-abelian as matrix multiplications don't commute.
