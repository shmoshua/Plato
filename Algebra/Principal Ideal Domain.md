> [!definition]
> An [[Ideal|ideal]] $\mathfrak{a}$ is called ***principal ideal***, if it is generated by a singleton set, i.e. $\mathfrak{a}=(a)$. 
> 
> A ***principal ideal domain (PID)*** is an [[integral domain]] where every ideal is a principal ideal.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Proposition 1
> $\mathbb{Z}$ is a principal ideal domain, where every ideal has the form $\mathfrak{a}=m\mathbb{Z}$. 

> [!proof]-
> Let $\mathfrak{a}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ be an ideal and let $m:= \min\{ a\in \mathfrak{a}:a>0 \}$. If $m$ does not exist, then $\mathfrak{a}=\{ 0 \}=0\mathbb{Z}$. 
> 
> For every $x\in \mathfrak{a}$, exists $b,r\in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $x=bm+r$ with $0\leq r<m$, i.e. $r=x-bm\in \mathfrak{a}$. However, from $r<m$, we have that $r=0$. It follows that $x\in m\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. $\mathfrak{a}=m\mathbb{Z}$.

> [!lemma] Theorem 2
> Let $R$ be a integral domain. Then, $R[X]$ is a principal ideal domain if and only if $R$ is a [[field]].

> [!proof]-
><=: Let $R$ be a field and $\mathfrak{a}\subseteq R[X]$ be an ideal s.t. $\mathfrak{a}\neq(0)$. We will show that $\mathfrak{a}$ is generated by one element. 
> 
> Let $q\in \mathfrak{a}$ be the element of minimal degree in $\mathfrak{a}$ s.t. $q\neq 0$. More concretely, $$q=b_{0}+b_{1}X+\dots+b_{m}X^m$$s.t. $b_{m}\neq 0$ and $\text{deg}(q)\geq 0$. We will show that $\mathfrak{a}=(q)$.
> 
> For $p\in \mathfrak{a}$, there exists $s,r\in R[X]$ with $\text{deg}(r)<\text{deg}(q)$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $$b_{m}^kp=sq+r$$
> As $R$ is a field and $b_{m}\neq 0$, $b_{m}^k$ is invertible and $$p=b_{m}^{-k}sq+b_{m}^{-k}r$$However, as $p\in \mathfrak{a}$ and $b_{m}^{-k}sq\in \mathfrak{a}$, $b_{m}^{-k}r\in \mathfrak{a}$ with degree smaller than $q$. As $q$ has the minimal degree in $\mathfrak{a}$, $r=0$ and $p=b_{m}^{-k}sq$. Therefore, $\mathfrak{a}=(q)$. 
> 
> =>: Conversely assume that $R[X]$ is a principal ideal ring. Let $a\in R$ and $a\neq 0$. Then, $(\{ a,X \})=(p)\subseteq R[X]$ for some $p\in R[X]$ as $R[X]$ is a principal ideal ring. This means $a=pq$ and $X=pr$ for some $q,r\in R[X]$. However, as $R$ is an integral domain, by degree assumption, 
> 1. $a=p$ and
> 2. $r=b+cX$
>    
> Therefore, $X=ab+acX$ and $ac=1$.
