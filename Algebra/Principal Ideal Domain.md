##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1 (Equivalence of Fields)
> Let $R$ be a integral domain. Then, TFAE:
> 1. $R[X]$ is a principal ideal domain.
> 2. $R$ is a [[field]].

> [!proof]-
> We have:
> 1. (1=>2): Let $R[X]$ be a PID. Let we will show that $R$ is a division ring. Let $0\neq a\in R$. Then, $(\{ a,X \})=(p)\unlhd R[X]$ as $R[X]$ is a PID. Therefore, $a=pq$ and $X=pr$ for some $q,r\in R[X]$. However, as $R$ is an integral domain, we have that:
>    - $0=\deg(a)=\deg(pq)=\deg(p)+\deg(q)$ and $\deg(p)=0$ and $\deg(q)=0$.
>    - $1=\deg(x)=\deg(pr)=\deg(p)+\deg(r)$ and $r=bX+c$ where $b,c\in R$. 
>      
>    Therefore, $X=pbX+pc$ and  $pb=1$ and $p\in R[X]^\times$. Hence, $(\{ a,X \})=R[X]$.
>    
>    However, this means that there exists $s,t\in R[X]$ s.t. $as+Xt=1$. Again, by degree assumptions, $as=1$ and $a\in R[X]^{\times}=R^\times$.
> 2. (2=>1): Let $R$ be a field and $I\subseteq R[X]$ an ideal s.t. $I\neq(0)$. 
>    
>    Let $q\in I$ be the element of minimal degree in $I$ s.t. $q\neq 0$. More concretely, $$q=b_{0}+b_{1}X+\dots+b_{m}X^m$$s.t. $b_{m}\neq 0$ and $\text{deg}(q)\geq 0$. We will show that $I=(q)$.
>    
>    For $p\in I$, by the [[Polynomial Ring|Euclidean algorithm]] there exists unique $s,r\in R[X]$ with $\text{deg}(r)<\text{deg}(q)$ and s.t. $$p=sq+r$$
>    
>    However, as $p\in I$ and $sq\in I$, $r\in I$ with degree smaller than $q$. As $q$ has the minimal degree in $I$, $r=0$ and $p=sq$. Therefore, $I=(q)$.

> [!lemma] Theorem 2 (Equivalent Definitions of GCD)
> Let $R$ be a principal ideal domain and $a,b\in R \backslash \{ 0 \}$. Then, for $d\in R$, TFAE
> 1. $d=\text{gcd}(a,b)$
> 2. $(a,b)=(d)$
> 3. there exist $x,y\in R$ s.t. $d=ax+by$ and for all $s,t\in R$, $d|as+bt$.
> 4. there exist $x,y\in R$ s.t. $d=ax+by$ and $d|a$ and $d|b$.

> [!proof]-
> 
> We have (from [[Integral Domain|Proposition 3]]):
> 1. (2=>3): Obvious.
> 2. (3=>4): Take $s=1$ and $t=0$ and vice versa.
> 3. (4=>1): We have $d|a$ and $d|b$. Further, if $c\in R$ exists with $c|a$ and $c|b$, then $c|ax$ and $c|by$. Therefore, $c|ax+by=d$. Therefore, $d=\gcd(a,b)$.
> 4. (1=>2): As $R$ is a PID, there exists $c\in R$ s.t. $(a,b)=(c)$. Then, there exists $x,y\in R$ with $c=ax+by$ and $c|a$ and $c|b$. Therefore, $c|d$ and $(d)\subseteq(c)$. However, as $d|a$ and $d|b$, $(a,b)\subseteq(d)$. Hence, $(a,b)=(d)$.

> [!lemma] Proposition 3
> In a principal ideal domain $R$, let $0\neq x\in R$. Then, the following are equivalent.
> 1. $x$ is [[Integral Domain|prime]].
> 2. $x$ is [[Integral Domain|irreducible]].
> 3. $(x)$ is a [[prime ideal]].
> 4. $(x)$ is a [[maximal ideal]].

> [!proof]-
> We have:
> 1. (1=>2): By [[Integral Domain|Lemma 2]], a prime element is irreducible in an ID.
> 1. (2=>1): Let $x$ be irreducible. Then, $x\notin R^\times$ and let $a,b\in R$ s.t. $x|ab$. If $x|a$, we are done. Assume $x\nmid a$. We claim that $\gcd(x,a)=1$. 
>    
>    Let $u\in R$ s.t. $u|x$. Then, as $x$ is irreducible, $u\in R^\times$ or $u\sim x$. However, as $x\nmid a$, if $u|a$ then $u\in R^\times$. Therefore, for any $u\in R$ if $u|x$ and $u|a$ then $u\in R^\times$. Then, clearly $u|1$. 
>    
>    Therefore, by Theorem 2, there exists $p,q\in R$ s.t. $1=pa+qx$. Then, $$b=bpa+bqx=xrp+bqx=x(rp+bq)$$for some $r\in R$ as $x|ab$. Hence, $x|b$ and we have the statement.
> 3. (1=>3): [[Integral Domain|Lemma 2]]
> 4. (3=>1): [[Integral Domain|Lemma 2]]
> 5. (3=>4): Let $(x)$ be a prime ideal and suppose $(p)\subseteq(m)$. Then, as $p$ is irreducible, we have that $m\in R^\times$ or $m\sim p$. If $m\in R^\times$ then $(m)=R$ and if $m\sim p$, then $(p)=(m)$.
> 6. (4=>3): A maximal ideal is a prime ideal as $R /(x)$ is a field and hence an integral domain.

##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1
> $\mathbb{Z}$ is a principal ideal domain, where every ideal has the form $\mathfrak{a}=m\mathbb{Z}$. 

> [!proof]-
> Let $\mathfrak{a}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ be an ideal and let $m:= \min\{ a\in \mathfrak{a}:a>0 \}$. If $m$ does not exist, then $\mathfrak{a}=\{ 0 \}=0\mathbb{Z}$. 
> 
> For every $x\in \mathfrak{a}$, exists $b,r\in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $x=bm+r$ with $0\leq r<m$, i.e. $r=x-bm\in \mathfrak{a}$. However, from $r<m$, we have that $r=0$. It follows that $x\in m\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. $\mathfrak{a}=m\mathbb{Z}$.
