##### Properties
> [!lemma] Proposition 1
> $\mathbb{Z}$ is a principal ideal domain, where every ideal has the form $\mathfrak{a}=m\mathbb{Z}$. 

> [!proof]-
> Let $\mathfrak{a}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ be an ideal and let $m:= \min\{ a\in \mathfrak{a}:a>0 \}$. If $m$ does not exist, then $\mathfrak{a}=\{ 0 \}=0\mathbb{Z}$. 
> 
> For every $x\in \mathfrak{a}$, exists $b,r\in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $x=bm+r$ with $0\leq r<m$, i.e. $r=x-bm\in \mathfrak{a}$. However, from $r<m$, we have that $r=0$. It follows that $x\in m\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. $\mathfrak{a}=m\mathbb{Z}$.

> [!lemma] Theorem 2
> Let $R$ be a integral domain. Then, $R[X]$ is a principal ideal domain if and only if $R$ is a [[field]].

> [!proof]-
><=: Let $R$ be a field and $\mathfrak{a}\subseteq R[X]$ be an ideal s.t. $\mathfrak{a}\neq(0)$. We will show that $\mathfrak{a}$ is generated by one element. 
> 
> Let $q\in \mathfrak{a}$ be the element of minimal degree in $\mathfrak{a}$ s.t. $q\neq 0$. More concretely, $$q=b_{0}+b_{1}X+\dots+b_{m}X^m$$s.t. $b_{m}\neq 0$ and $\text{deg}(q)\geq 0$. We will show that $\mathfrak{a}=(q)$.
> 
> For $p\in \mathfrak{a}$, there exists $s,r\in R[X]$ with $\text{deg}(r)<\text{deg}(q)$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $$b_{m}^kp=sq+r$$
> As $R$ is a field and $b_{m}\neq 0$, $b_{m}^k$ is invertible and $$p=b_{m}^{-k}sq+b_{m}^{-k}r$$However, as $p\in \mathfrak{a}$ and $b_{m}^{-k}sq\in \mathfrak{a}$, $b_{m}^{-k}r\in \mathfrak{a}$ with degree smaller than $q$. As $q$ has the minimal degree in $\mathfrak{a}$, $r=0$ and $p=b_{m}^{-k}sq$. Therefore, $\mathfrak{a}=(q)$. 
> 
> =>: Conversely assume that $R[X]$ is a principal ideal ring. Let $a\in R$ and $a\neq 0$. Then, $(\{ a,X \})=(p)\subseteq R[X]$ for some $p\in R[X]$ as $R[X]$ is a principal ideal ring. This means $a=pq$ and $X=pr$ for some $q,r\in R[X]$. However, as $R$ is an integral domain, by degree assumption, 
> 1. $a=p$ and
> 2. $r=b+cX$
>    
> Therefore, $X=ab+acX$ and $ac=1$.

> [!lemma] Theorem 3
> Let $R$ be a principal ideal domain and $a,b\in R \backslash \{ 0 \}$. Then, for $d\in R$, the following are equivalent:
> 1. $d=\text{gcd}(a,b)$
> 2. $(a,b)=(d)$
> 3. there exist $x,y\in R$ s.t. $d=ax+by$ and for all $s,t\in R$, $d|as+bt$.
> 4. there exist $x,y\in R$ s.t. $d=ax+by$ and $d|a$ and $d|b$.

> [!proof]-
> We have: 
> - (2=>3): SInce $d\in (a,b)$, there exists $x,y\in R$ s.t. $d=ax+by$. Further, for $s,t\in R$, $as+bt\in (a,b)=(d)$. Therefore, $d|as+bt$.
> - (3=>4): By choosing $(s,t)=(1,0)$ and $(s,t)=(0,1)$ it follows.
> - (4=>2): As $d=ax+by$, $d\in (a,b)$ and $(d)\subseteq(a,b)$. However, by assumption, $a,b\in (d)$. Therefore, $(a,b)\subseteq(d)$.
> - (1=>2): As $R$ is a PID, there exists $c\in R$ s.t. $(a,b)=(c)$. Therefore, $c|a$, $c|b$ and  $c|d$. This shows that $(d)\subseteq(c)$. On the other hand, $d|a$, $d|b$ and $a,b\in (d)$. Therefore, $(c)\subseteq(d)$. So $(c)=(d)$.
> - (4=>1): By assumption $d|a$ and $d|b$. Assume there exists $c\in R$ with $c|a,c|b$. Then, $c|ax$ and $c|by$. Therefore, $c|ax+by=d$. Therefore, $d=\text{gcd}(a,b)$.

> [!lemma] Proposition 4
> In a principal ideal domain $R$, 
> 1. $x\in R$ is a [[Integral Domain|prime]] if and only if $x$ is [[Integral Domain|irreducible]]. 
> 2. every non-zero [[prime ideal]] $\mathfrak{p}$ is [[Maximal Ideal|maximal]].

> [!proof]+
> We have
> 1. By [[Integral Domain|Lemma 2]], a prime element is irreducible.
> 2. Let $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq R$ be a non-zero prime. As $R$ is a PID, then there exists $p\in R$ s.t. $\mathfrak{p}=(p)$ and from [[Integral Domain|Lemma 2]], $p$ is prime. Therefore, $p$ is irreducible. 
>    
>    Hence, for any $m\in R$ s.t. $(p)\subseteq(m)$, $p=am$. From the irreducibility, $m\in R^{*}$ or $a\in R^{*}$. If $m\in R^{*}$, then $(m)=R$. Conversely, if $a\in R^{*}$, then $m\sim p$ are associates, i.e. $(m)=(p)$.
