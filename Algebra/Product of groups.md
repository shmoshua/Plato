> [!definition]
> For any two groups $(G,\circ_{G})$ and $(H,\circ_{H})$, the ***product*** of $G$ and $H$ is a group $(G\times H,\circ)$ denoted as:
> $$G \times H:=\{ (x,y): x\in G \land y \in H \}$$
> with the operation $\circ$ defined as:
> $$(x_{1},y_{1})\circ(x_{2},y_{2})=(x_{1} \circ_{G}x_{2},y_{1}\circ_{H}y_{2})$$

- $G\times H$ is abelian if both $G,H$ are abelian.
