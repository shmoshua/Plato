#Definition #Algebra 

> [!definition]
> Let $G$ be a [[topological group]] and $X$ a [[topological space]]. Then, a [[group action]] $G\curvearrowright X$ is ***properly discontinuous*** if every point $x\in X$ has an open neighborhood $U\ni x$ s.t. $$gU\cap U=\varnothing,\quad \forall g\neq e$$

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> Let $M$ be a [[smooth manifold]] and $G\leq \text{Diff}(M)$. If $G\curvearrowright M$ is a properly discontinuous action, 
> 1. $M/G$ is a smooth manifold.
> 2. $\pi:M\to M / G$ is a [[Covering Space|smooth covering space]].
