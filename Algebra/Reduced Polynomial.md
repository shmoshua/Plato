> [!definition]
> A monic polynomial $f(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_{0}$ is called ***reduced*** if $a_{n-1}=0$.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> For a monic polynomial $f\in K[X]$ of degree $n$, 
> 1. the corresponding reduced polynomial is given by $\tilde{f}(x):=f\left( x- \frac{a_{n-1}}{n} \right)$.
> 2. $D_{f}=D_{\tilde{f}}$, where $D$ denotes the [[discriminant]].
