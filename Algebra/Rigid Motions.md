> A ***rigid motion*** of a solid $S$ is a bijection $\varphi:S \to S$ which has the following property: The solid $S$ can be moved through 3-dimensional Euclidean space in such a way that it does not change its shape and when the movement stops, i.e. each point $p\in S$ is in position $\varphi(p)$.
