> [!definition]
> For a [[field]] $F$, 
> 1. a polynomial $g\in F[X]$ is called ***separable*** over $F$ if each of its irreducible factors has distinct roots in a splitting field.
> 2. an algebraic element $\alpha$ over $F$ is called ***separable*** over $F$ if $m_{\alpha,F}$ is separable over $F$.
> 3. an algebraic extension $K:F$ is called ***separable*** if every $\alpha\in K$ is separable.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Lemma 1
> Let $L:K$ be a separable algebraic extension and $M$ an intermediate field. Then, both $L:M$ and $M:K$ are separable.

> [!proof]+
> Clearly, $M:K$ is separable by definition. Now, let $\alpha\in L$ and $m_{\alpha,K}$ and $m_{\alpha,L}$ be the minimal polynomials of $\alpha$
