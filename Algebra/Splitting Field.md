> A [[Extension Field|field extension]] $L:F$ is a ***splitting field*** of a polynomial $f(x)\in F[X]$ if $f$ factors completely in $L[X]$ and $f$ does not split in any intermediate field $F\subseteq K\subsetneq L$

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> Let $F$ is a field and $f(x)\in F[X]$ a polynomial of degree $n$. Then, there exists a splitting field $K$ of $F$ s.t. $[K:F]\leq n!$
