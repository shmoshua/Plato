> [!definition]
> The ***tetrahedron group*** $T$ is the group of rotational symmetries of a tetrahedron.
---
##### Profile
1. **Order**: $\left| T \right|=12$.

> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> $T\cong A_{4}$

##### Subgroups
As $\left| T \right|=12$, we can have subgroups of order 1,2,3,4,6,12.
1. Subgroups of order 1: $\{ \iota \}$
2. Subgroups of order 2: 

- $T\cong (C_{2}\times C_{2})\rtimes_{\kappa}C_{3}$
