> [!definition]
> For a [[Ring|ring]] $R$, an element $a\in R$ is called:
> 1. ***left zero divisor***, if there exists $b\neq 0$, s.t. $a\cdot b=0_{R}$.
> 2. ***right zero divisor***, if there exists $b\neq 0$, s.t. $b\cdot a=0_{R}$.
> 
> If $R$ has no non-trivial zero divisors, it is called a ***domain***. 

- **Remark**: If $R$ is commutative, every left zero divisor is a right zero divisor and vice versa.
- **Remark**: It is possible for an element to be neither zero divisor nor a [[unit]]:
	  - $R=C([0,1],\mathbb{R})$ and $h(x)=x-\frac{1}{2}$. $h$ is not a unit as $h\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)=0$, but also doesn't have a zero divisor as $hk=0$ implies that $k=0$.
