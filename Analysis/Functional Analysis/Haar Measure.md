> [!definition]
> Let $G$ be a [[Locally Compact Topological Group|locally compact Hausdorff topological group]]. Then, we can define a left regular representation $\rho:G \to \text{GL}(C_{00}(G))$ as: $$\rho(g)f(x)=f(g^{-1}x)$$

##### Properties

> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> Let $G$ be a locally compact Hausdorff topological group. Then, there is up to scaling a unique positive linear functional $\Lambda :C_{00}(G)\to \mathbb{C}$ that is invariant under left translation: $$\Lambda(\rho(g)f)=\Lambda(f), \quad \forall f\in C_{00}(G),g\in G$$Then, $\Lambda$ is called the ***left Haar functional***.

> [!lemma] Corollary 2
> There exists up to a strictly positive scalar multiple, a unique, non-zero positive regular Borel measure $\mu$ on $G$ s.t. for every measurable set $E\subseteq G$ and $g\in G$: $$\mu(gE)=\mu(E)$$ s.t. $$\Lambda(f)=\int_{G}^{} f \, d\mu $$
