> Let $g:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be [[Piecewise Continuous Function|piecewise continuous]] with discontinuity set $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then, for all $t_{0}\in \mathbb{R}$, the function $f(t)=\int_{t_{0}}^{t} g(\tau) \, d\tau$ is [[Continuous Functions in Normed Spaces|continuous]] and for all $t\in \mathbb{R} \backslash D$, $$\frac{d}{dt}f(t)=\frac{d}{dt}\int_{t_{0}}^{t} g(\tau) \, d\tau =g(t)$$
