> The function $p:X \to Y$ is ***Lipschitz in $x$*** if there exists $k\geq 0$ s.t. for all $x,x'\in X$: $$d_{Y}( p(x),p(x')) \leq k\cdot d_{X}(x,x') $$
> Then, $k$ is called the ***Lipschitz constant*** of $p$.
- **Remark**: All linear functions are Lipschitz.
- **Remark**: All differentiable functions with bounded derivatives are Lipschitz.
- **Remark**: There are Lipschitz functions that are not differentiable: **Example**: $\left| \cdot \right|:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$.
- **Remark**: All Lipschitz functions are continuous, but not all continuous functions are Lipschitz. **Example**: $f(x)=x^2$.
