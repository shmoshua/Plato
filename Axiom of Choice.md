> For a family of mutually disjoint sets $\mathcal{F}:=\{ E_{\alpha}:\alpha\in A \}$ where $A$ is some index set, the ***axiom of choice*** specifies the existence of a choice function $f:A \to \bigcup_{\alpha\in A}^{}E_{\alpha}, \alpha\mapsto x_{\alpha}\in E_{\alpha}$, i.e. there is a set consisting of exactly one element from each $E_{\alpha}$ for $\alpha\in A$.
