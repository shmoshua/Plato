#### Problem 1. A different kind of Smoothness
##### Part A. 
1. This follows from the fact that $x\mapsto x^\top y$ is a continuous function and $S^1:=\{ x\in \mathbb{R}^n: \|x\|=1 \}$ is compact. For the compactness, we have by Heine-Borel that $S^1$ is bounded and closed as $S^1$ is a preimage of a
