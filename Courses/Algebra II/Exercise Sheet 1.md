> Let $R$ be a principal ideal domain. 
> 1. Show that every ascending chain of ideals, $I_{1}\subseteq I_{2}\subseteq\dots$ , eventually become stationary. In other words, there is a positive index $n$ such that $I_{k}=I_{n}$ for all $k\geq n$. 
> 2. Show that every irreducible element is a prime element.

We have:
1. Let $\{ I_{k} \}_{k}$ be an ascending chain of ideals. We claim that $I:=\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}I_{k}$ is an ideal. For $x,y\in I$, there exists $a,b\geq 1$ s.t. $x\in I_{a}$ and $y\in I_{}b$
