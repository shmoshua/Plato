> [!def] Problem 1
> In the Euclidean plane consider the following two operations:
> 1. [Ruler] Given two points $P,Q$, we can draw a straight line through them.
> 2. [Compass] Given two points $P,Q$ draw a circle whose center is one of $P,Q$ and whose radius is equal to the distance between the given points.
> 
> Assume we are given two distinct points $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$ in the plane. Through translation, rotation and stretching, we can assume that $P_{0}=(0,0)$ and $P_{1}=(1,0)$.
> 
> We say a point $P$ is ***constructible*** if there exists a finite sequence of points $P_{0},P_{1},\dots,P_{n}=P$ in the plane with the following property: Let for $1\leq j\leq n$: $$S_{j}:=\{ P_{0},\dots,P_{j} \}$$ For each $2\leq j\leq n$, $P_{j}$ is either:
> 1. the intersection of two distinct straight lines, each joining two points of $S_{j-1}$, or
> 2. a point of intersection of a straight line joining two points of $S_{j-1}$ and a circle with centre a point of $S_{j-1}$ and radius the distance between two points of $S_{j-1}$, or
> 3. a point of intersection of two distinct circles, each with centre a point of $S_{j-1}$ and radius the distance between two points of $S_{j-1}$.
>    
>   In case 3, the centres must be different if the circles are to intersect: the radii may or may not be different.
>   
>   If $P=(x,y)$ is a constructible point, we consider the extension $\mathbb{Q}(x,y):\mathbb{Q}$ generated by $x$ and $y$. In this exercise weâ€™ll prove that if $P=(x,y)$ is a constructible point, the extension $\mathbb{Q}(x,y):\mathbb{Q}$ is finite, and $[\mathbb{Q}(x,y):\mathbb{Q}]=2^r$ , for some non-negative integer $r$.
>   
>   Let $P_{0},P_{1},\dots,P_{n}=P$ be a sequence of points which satisfies the requirements of the definition of $P$ being constructible. Let $P_{j}=(x_{j},y_{J})$ and for $1\leq j\leq n$ let $$F_{j}=\mathbb{Q}(x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2},\dots,x_{j},y_{j})$$s.t. $F_{j+1}=F_{j}(x_{j+1},y_{j+1})$, for $1\leq j<n$.
>   1. Prove that $[F_{j+1}:F_{j}]=1$, if $(x_{j+1},y_{j+1})$ is the intersection of two distinct straight lines, each joining two points of $S_{j}$, i.e. arises from an intersection point of type 1.
>   2. Prove that $[F_{j+1}:F_{j}]=1$ or $2$, if $(x_{j+1},y_{j+1})$ is a point of intersection of an appropriate straight line and circle, i.e. arises from an intersection point of type 2.
>   3. Prove that $[F_{j+1}:F_{j}]=1$ or $2$, if $(x_{j+1},y_{j+1})$ is a point of intersection of two circles.
>   4. Show that $$[F_{n}:F_{1}]=[F_{n}:\mathbb{Q}]=2^s$$for some $s\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ and conclude: $$[\mathbb{Q}(x,y):\mathbb{Q}]=2^r$$for some non-negative integer $r$.

We have: 
1. We will show that $x_{j+1},y_{j+1}\in F_{j}$. Let $(a_{i},b_{i})\in S_{j}$ for $1\leq i\leq 4$. Then, $$\frac{b_{2}-b_{1}}{a_{2}-a_{1}}x_{j+1}+ \frac{b_{1}a_{2}-a_{1}b_{2}}{a_{2}-a_{1}}=\frac{b_{4}-b_{3}}{a_{4}-a_{3}}x_{j+1}+ \frac{b_{3}a_{4}-a_{3}b_{4}}{a_{4}-a_{3}}$$
