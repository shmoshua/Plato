> [!def] Problem 1
> In the Euclidean plane consider the following two operations:
> 1. [Ruler] Given two points $P,Q$, we can draw a straight line through them.
> 2. [Compass] Given two points $P,Q$ draw a circle whose center is one of $P,Q$ and whose radius is equal to the distance between the given points.
> 
> Assume we are given two distinct points $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$ in the plane. Through translation, rotation and stretching, we can assume that $P_{0}=(0,0)$ and $P_{1}=(1,0)$.
> 
> We say a point $P$ is ***constructible*** if there exists a finite sequence of points $P_{0},P_{1},\dots,P_{n}=P$ in the plane with the following property: Let for $1\leq j\leq n$: $$S_{j}:=\{ P_{0},\dots,P_{j} \}$$ For each $2\leq j\leq n$, $P_{j}$ is either:
> 1. the intersection of two distinct straight lines, each joining two points of $S_{j-1}$, or
> 2. a point of intersection of a straight line joining two points of $S_{j-1}$ and a circle with centre a point of $S_{j-1}$ and radius the distance between two points of $S_{j-1}$, or
