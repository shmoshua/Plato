> Let $K$ be a field of characteristic 0 and $L:K$ a finite algebraic extension. Show that $L:K$ is simple if and only if there are only finitely many intermediate fields.

Assume that $L:K$ is simple. Then, $L=K(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha\in L$ and $[L:K]=n$. Let $F$ be an intermediate field. Then, $$m_{\alpha,F}|m_{\alpha,K}\text{ in }F[X]$$
