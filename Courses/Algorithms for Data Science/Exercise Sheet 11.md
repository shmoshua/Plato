### 1. Sum of Squares HÃ¶lder-like Inequality

Let $C>0$ and $t:= 4k$. By defining $z_{1},z_{2}:=\frac{\|v\|}{C}$ and $z_{i}:= 1$ for all $i\geq 3$, we have that: $$\vdash \frac{\|v\|^{2}}{C^{2}}\leq \frac{1}{t}\left( 2\frac{\|v\|^t}{C^t}+(t-2)\cdot 1 \right) $$as $t$ is even. By multiplying both sides by $C^{2}$ (which we can do as $C^{2}$ can split in the sum of squares), we have our statement.
