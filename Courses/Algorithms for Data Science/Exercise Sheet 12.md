#### 1. The Median as a Robust Mean Estimator
Notice that $Y_{i}-\mu ^{*}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Hence, we have that: $$\mathbb{P}(Y_{i}<\mu ^{*}-C\varepsilon)=\Phi(-C\varepsilon)=1-\Phi(C\varepsilon)$$Therefore, it suffices to show that there exists a $C$ large enough s.t. for all $0<\varepsilon<1/C$, $\Phi(C\varepsilon)\geq \frac{1}{2}+2\varepsilon$.
