For $f(x)=\left| x \right|^{-1/2}$, 
1. the Fourier coefficients are well-defined as $f\in L^1([-\pi,\pi])$. We have: $\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \left| x \right| ^{-1/2} \, dx=4\sqrt{ \pi }$.
2. No, $f\notin L^2([-\pi,\pi])$. 
3. $f(x)$ is not even defined for $x=0$? As $f$ is not bounded, it cannot be uniformly continuous and therefore it is not $\alpha$-Hölder continuous on $(-\pi,\pi)$, so we cannot apply Theorem 2.27. At $x=\pm \pi$, $f$ is Hölder and $S_{N}(f)(x)\to f(x)$.
4. $f$ is not even continuous.
