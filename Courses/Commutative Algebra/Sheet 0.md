> [!def] Problem 1
> Let $I_{1},\dots,I_{k}$ be pairwise coprime ideals (in a commutative ring). Show that $I_{1}\dots I_{k}=I_{1}\cap\dots \cap I_{k}$.

We first show it for two coprime ideals $I,J$. The inclusion $IJ\subseteq I\cap J$ holds trivially by definition. For any $x\in I\cap J$, as $I,J$ are coprime, let $1=y+z$ where $y\in I$ and $z\in J$. We have that $x=xy+xz\in IJ$.

We will show the statement by induction over $k$. For $k\geq 2$, as $I_{1}\dots I_{k-1}$ is an ideal. Further, for any $x\in R$,  and especially it is coprime as: $I_{1}\dots I_{k-1}+I_{k}=R$. Then, $$I_{1}\dots I_{k-1}+I_{k}=I_{1}\dots I_{k-1}+(I_{1}\dots I_{k-2}+R)I_{k}=I_{1}\dots I_{k-2}\underbrace{ (I_{k-1}+I_{k}) }_{ =R }+I_{k}=I_{1}\dots I_{k-2}+I_{k}$$By recursively continuing, we get that $I_{1}\dots I_{k-1}+I_{k}=I_{1}+I_{k}=R$. Therefore, this reduces to the case of two coprime ideals and we have the statement.

> [!def] Problem 3
> Let $I\subseteq J$ be ideals in a ring $R$. $J / I$ is an ideal in $R / I$. Show that $$(R / I) / (J / I)\cong R / J$$

We define the homomorphism: $$\varphi:R / I \to R / J,\quad x+I\mapsto x+J$$
