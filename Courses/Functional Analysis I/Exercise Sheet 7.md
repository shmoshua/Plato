##### Problem 1
Assume $E$ has a closed complement $F$. Then, $f:E \times F\to V, (x,y)\mapsto x+y$ has a bounded inverse by the open mapping theorem. Therefore, we define: $$V\xrightarrow{\varphi ^{-1}}E\times F\xrightarrow{(e,f)\mapsto e}E\hookrightarrow V$$as $P$. Then, as the first two maps are surjective, so $\text{Im }P=E$.

##### Problem 3
1. **$V$ is closed**: 
	We define $T: \ell^1(\mathbb{N})\to \ell^1(\mathbb{N})$ s.t. $T(f)(n)=f(2n)$. Then, $\left\| Tf \right\|_{1}\leq \left\| f \right\|_{1}$. It follows that $V=\text{ker }T$ is closed.
2. **$W$ is closed**:
