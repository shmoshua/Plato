##### Exercise 1
> Let $A$ be a unital $\mathbb{C}$-algebra and $x\in A$. Suppose there are $y,z\in A$ with $xy=zx=e$. Prove $y=z$. Moreover, prove that if there is $y'\in A$ with $xy'=e$ then $y'=y$.

We have that $\begin{align}y=ey=zxy=ze=z\end{align}$. Further, $xy'=xy=yx=e$. Therefore, $y'=y$.

##### Exercise 2
> Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space, which is not compact. Denote by $\alpha X$ the one-point compactification of $X$. Show that the unital algebra $C_{0}(X)_{I}$ is canonically isomorphic to $C(\alpha X)$.
