> Recall that a compact Hausdorff space $S$ is called totally disconnected if the connected components of $S$ are precisely the points. For each compact Hausdorff space $S$, we define $$C_{\text{fin}}(S):=\{ f\in C(S):\left| \text{im}(f) \right| <+\infty \}$$Note that $C_{\text{fin}}(S)$ is an involutive and unital subalgebra of $C(S)$.
> 1. Prove that the following conditions are equivalent for a compact Hausdorff space $S$:
> 	1. The space $S$ is totally disconnected. 
> 	2. For each pair of disctinct points $s_{1},s_{2}\in S$ there exists a clopen decomposition $S=S_{1}\sqcup S_{2}$ s.t. $s_{1}\in S_{1}$ and $s_{2}\in S_{2}$. 
> 	3. For each pair of distinct points $s_{1},s_{2} \in S$ there exists a continuous function $\phi:S\to \{ 0,1 \}$ s.t. $\phi(s_{1})=0$ and $\phi(s_{2})=1$. 
> 	4. The subalgebra $C_{\text{fin}}(S)\subseteq C(S)$  is dense.
> 2. Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Prove that there exists a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space $S$ and a continuous surjection $S\to X$.

We have: 
1. We will show as follows:
	- (1=>2): Let $s_{1},s_{2}\in S$ be two disjoint points and take $S_{1}=\{ s_{1} \}$ and $S_{2}:= S \backslash \{ s_{1} \}$. As $S$ is Hausdorff, $S_{1}$ is closed.
