##### Problem 1
If $T$ is continuous, then $\text{ker}(T)=T^{-1}[\{ 0 \}]$ is closed as $\{ 0 \}$ is closed.
Conversely, if $\text{ker}(T)$ is closed,

##### Problem 3
Without loss of generality we can assume that $\left\| x_{0} \right\|=1$. Then, we define: $$\begin{array}{cccc} {f:}&{\mathbb{R}x_{0}}&\to&{\mathbb{R}}\\&{tx_{0}} &\mapsto & {t} \end{array}{}$$Consider $p:V\to \mathbb{R}$ as $p(x)=\|x\|$. Then, $p$ is a gauge and $f(tx_{0})=t\leq \left| t \right|=p(tx_{0})$. Therefore, from Hahn-Banach, there exists a linear extension $F:V\to \mathbb{R}$ of $f$. Then, 
1. $F(x_{0})=f(x_{0})=1$ and
2.
