##### Problem 1
Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and $\geq 2n-2$ edges. We notice that there is a connected component $C$ of $G$ s.t. $G[C]$ has $\geq 2\left| C \right|-2$ edges. Hence, wlog we may assume that $G$ is connected.

Let $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$. As any new edge added create exactly one cycle by Corollary 2.8, and we have at least $n-1$ different edges we could add,
