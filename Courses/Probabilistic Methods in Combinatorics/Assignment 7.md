##### Problem 1
We will show that $p_{0}=n^{-2/3}$ is a weak threshold. Let $G\sim G(n,p)$ and $X$ denote the number of copies of $H$ in $G$. Then, we have that: 
1. $\mathbb{E}[X]=5{n \choose 5}p^7$ and 
2. For $S,T\in{[n] \choose 5}$ and $X_{S},X_{T}$ indicator variables, we have that: $$\text{Cov}(X_{S},X_{T})=\begin{cases}5p^7-25p^{14}&S=T\\16 p^8+\end{cases}$$
