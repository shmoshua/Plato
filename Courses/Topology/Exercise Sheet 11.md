> A topological space $X$ is called ***path-connected*** if, for every $x$ and $y$ in $X$, there exists a path $\gamma:[0,1]\to X$ s.t. $\gamma(0)=x$ and $\gamma(1)=y$.
> 1. Show that if $X$ is path-connected, then it is connected. 
> 2. Show that the relation $\sim$ defined by $x\sim y$ if and only if there exists a path in $X$ from $x\sim y$ is an equivalence relation. 
> 3. Show that the equivalence class of some $x\in X$ for the relation $\sim$ is contained in the connected component of $x\in X$. This equivalence class is called the path-connected component of $x$. 
> 4. We now assume that $X$ is a connected topological manifold. Show that the path-connected component of any $x\in X$ is open. 
> 5. Let $X$ be a contractible space. Show that $X$ is path connected. 

We have:
1. let $U_{1}\sqcup U_{2}=X$. If they are both non-empty, let $x\in U_{1}$ and $y\in U_{2}$.
