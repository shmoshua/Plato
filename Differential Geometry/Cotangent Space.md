> [!definition]
> Let $M$ be a [[smooth manifold]]. The ***cotangent space*** $M$ at $p$ is the dual vector space of $T_{p}M$, denoted as $T^{*}_{p}M$. The elements of $T^{*}_{p}M$ are called ***covectors***.
- **Remark**: Given a chart $\varphi$, a basis of $T_{p}^{*}M$ is given by the ***coordinate differentials***: $$\begin{array}{cccc} {d_{p}\varphi^i:}&{T_{p}M}&\to&{\mathbb{R}}\\& \left. \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial \varphi^j } \right| _{p} &\mapsto & {\delta^i_{j}} \end{array}{}$$More generally, given $f\in C^\infty(M)$, the [[differential]] at $p$ is defined as $d_{p}f(V)=Vf$ for $V\in T_{p}M$.
