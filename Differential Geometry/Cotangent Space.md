> Let $M$ be a [[smooth manifold]]. The ***cotangent space*** $M$ at $p$ is the [[Dual Space|dual vector space]] of $T_{p}M$, denoted as $T^{*}_{p}M$. The elements of $T^{*}_{p}M$ are called ***covectors***.
- **Related definition**: Given a chart $(U,x)$, the coordinates are given by: $$\left. \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x^i } \right| _{p}= [x,e_{i}]_{p}$$Then, $d_{p}x^i:T_{p}M\to \mathbb{R},\left. \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x^j } \right| _{p}\mapsto \delta^i_{j}$ are called the ***coordinate differentials***.
