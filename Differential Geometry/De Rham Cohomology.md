> [!definition]
> Let $M$ be a [[smooth manifold]] and $d_{k}:\Omega^k(M)\to\Omega^{k+1}(M)$ the [[exterior derivative]] operator. Then, the ***$k$-th de Rham cohomology of $M$*** is the quotient vector space: $$\text{H}_{\text{dR}}^k(M):=\text{ker }d_{k}  /\text{im }d_{k-1}$$
- **Remark**: This is well defined as $\text{im } d_{k-1}\subseteq \text{ker }d_{k}$ given by [[Exterior Derivative|Theorem 3.3]].
- **Remark**: $\text{H}^0_{\text{dR}}(M)=\text{ker }d_{0}\cong\mathbb{R}^{\pi_{0}(M)}$ where $\pi_{0}(M)$ is the number of connected components in $M$.
