> [!definition]
> Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold. Then, the ***Euler characteristic*** is given by: $$\chi(M):=v-e+f$$where $v,e,f$ are the number of vertices, edges and triangles of a triangularization of $M$ respectively.
- **Remark**: The Euler characteristic $\chi(M)$ is independent of the triangularization.
