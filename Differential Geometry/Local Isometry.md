> Let $(N,h)$ and $(M,g)$ be two [[Riemannian Manifold|Riemannian manifolds]]. A map $F:(N,h)\to(M,g)$ is a ***local isometry***, if:
> 1. $F$ is a local diffeomorphism, i.e. for all $p\in N$ there exists an open neighborhood $U$ s.t. $f|_{U}$ is a diffeomorphism.
> 2. $F^{*}g=h$, where $F^{*}g$ is the [[Pullback|pullback metric]].
