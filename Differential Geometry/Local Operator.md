> [!definition]
> An operator $L:C^\infty(M)\to C^\infty(M)$ is ***local*** if for any open set $U\subseteq M$, 
> 1. for all $f,g\in C^\infty(M)$, if $f|_{U}=g|_{U}$, then $(Lf)|_{U}=(Lg)|_{U}$. 
---
##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. 
> 1. if $M$ is compact, every local operator is a differential operator.
---
##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1
> Every [[differential operator]] is a local operator.
