> [!definition]
> Let $(M,g)$ be a [[Riemannian Manifold|Riemannian manifold]]. Then, for $p\in M$, the ***musical isomorphisms*** are the following isomorphisms:$$\begin{array}{cccc} {\flat:}&{\text{T}_{p}M}&\to&{\text{T}_{p}^{*}M}\\&{v} &\mapsto & {v^\flat:=g_{p}(v,\cdot )} \end{array}{}$$and $\sharp:=\flat ^{-1}$.
- **Remark**: With $(U,\varphi)$ on $M$, in local coordinates, the Riemannian metric is $g=g_{ij}dx^i\otimes dx^j$ and for $v\in \text{T}M$, $v=v^i \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x^i }$.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Proposition
> For every $p\in M$, $\flat$ defines a vector space isomorphism.

> [!proof]-
> As $\flat$ is linear, we just have to check that $\flat$ is a bijection. The injectivity follows from the fact that $g_{p}$ defines an inner product. The surjectivity follows from
