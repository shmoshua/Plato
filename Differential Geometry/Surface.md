> A smooth surface $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}$ is a subset s.t. for all $p\in M$ there exists an open neighborhood $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}$ of $p$ s.t. 
> 1. there exists a smooth diffeomorphism $\phi:U\to \phi(U)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}$ s.t. $\phi(U\cap M)=\phi(U)\cap(\mathbb{R}^{3}\times\{ 0 \})$

- **Related definition**: Let $N(p)\in \mathbb{R}^3$ be a unit normal vector of the [[tangent space]] $\text{T}_{p}M$. Then, there is a ***unit normal field*** is a continuous function $N:M\to \mathbb{R}^3$, where the normal vector is chosen arbitrarily to make $N$ continuous.
- **Related definition**: A surface is ***non-orientable*** if such unit normal field cannot exist, e.g. MÃ¶bius strip.
- **Related definition**: A surface is ***developable*** if it is [[Isometry|locally isometric]] to a plane.

> the [[Extrinsic Curvature|Gauss curvature]] $K$ is [[Isometry|intrinsic]].
- **Remark**: There is a formula of $K$ expressed by the [[Riemannian metric]].
