> A ***topological manifold $M$ of dimension $m$*** is a 2nd-countable [[Hausdorff space]] s.t. for all $p\in M$, there exists an open neighborhood $U\subseteq M$ s.t. $\varphi :U\to \varphi(U)\subseteq\mathbb{R}^m$ is a homeomorphism.
- **Related definition**: $(\varphi,U)$ is called a ***chart***.
- **Related definition**: Two charts $(\phi,U),(\psi,V)$ are ***compatible***, if $\phi \circ\psi ^{-1}:\psi(U\cap V)\to \phi(U\cap V)$ is a smooth diffeomorphism.
