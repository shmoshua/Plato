> A [[topological group]] $G$ is ***LCA/locally compact abelian*** if:
> 1. $G$ is abelian
> 2. $G$ is [[Locally Compact Hausdorff Space|locally compact Hausdorff]].

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem (Bochner)
> Let $G$ be a LCA group and $\Phi:G\to \mathbb{C}$ continuous positive definite. Then, there exists a unique positive bounded measure $\mu$ on $\widehat{G}$ s.t. $$\Phi(x)=\int_{\widehat{G}}^{} (x,\chi) \, d\mu(\chi),\quad \forall x\in G $$
