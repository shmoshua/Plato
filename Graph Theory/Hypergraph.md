- **Related definition**: A hypergraph $(V,E)$ is ***$k$-uniform*** if $\left| e \right|=k$ for all $e\in E$. ^76aa99
- **Remark**: A standard graph is a $2$-uniform hypergraph. ^edbb24
- **Related definition**: A $k$-coloring of the vertices of a hypergraph $G$ is called ***proper***, if no edge in $G$ is monochromatic. ^fd7276
- **Related definition**: $m(k)$ is the smallest integer $m$ s.t. there exists a $k$-uniform hypergraph with $m$ edges for which there is no proper 2-coloring. ^68e4e2

> We have that:
> 1. (Lower bound) Let $m\leq 2^{k-1}$ and $G=(V,E)$ be a $k$-uniform hypergraph with $m$ edges. Let us color its vertices uniformly at random with 2 colors. For an edge $e\in E$, let $A_{e}$ denote the event that $e$ is monochromatic. Then, we have that $\mathbb{P}(A_{e})=2\cdot 2^{-k}$. Therefore, $$\mathbb{P}(\exists \text{monochromatic edge})=\mathbb{P}\left( \bigcup_{e\in E}^{} A_{e}\right)< m\cdot 2\cdot 2^{-k} =\frac{m}{2^{k-1}}$$where the last inequality is strict as there are events that are not disjoint. Therefore, there exists a monochromatic edge with probability $<1$. 
> 2. (Upper bound) We may assume that $k\geq 10$, because we can easily choose a constant $c$ so that $m(k)\leq ck^{2} 2^k$ holds for all $k<10$. Now, we will find a $k$-uniform hypergraph with $m=3k^22^k$ edges which is not 2-colorable.

>    Let $V:=[k^2]$ and we draw $m$ $k$-element subsets of $V$ with repetitions. Then, fix any 2-coloring on $G$. Then, there exists a subset of vertices of size at least $k^2 /2$ with the same color. The probability that a randomly chosen subset of size $k$ is contained in this subset is: $$\begin{align} \frac{{k^2/2 \choose k}}{k^{2} \choose k}=\prod_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{\frac{k^2}{2}-i}{k^2-i}&=\frac{1}{2^k}\prod_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{k^2-2i}{k^2-i}=\frac{1}{2^k}\prod_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( 1-\frac{i}{k^2-i} \right)\\&>\frac{1}{2^k}\prod_{i=0}^{k-1}\exp \left( -\frac{2i}{k^2-i} \right)  >\frac{1}{2^k}\exp \left( -\frac{2\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}i}{k^2-k} \right)  =2^{-k}e^{-1}\end{align}$$Therefore, the probability that an edge is not monochromatic is at most $1-2^{-k}e^{-1}$ and the probability that none of them are monochromatic is at most: $$(1-2^{-k}e^{-1})^m\leq \exp \left( -\frac{m}{e 2^k} \right) <e^{-k^{2}}$$Using this a union bound over all coverings $V(G)$, we get that the probability that there is a proper coloring is at most $e^{-k^{2}}2^{k^2}<1$, so there exists a hypergraph with $m$ edges with no proper 2-coloring.

- **Remark**: The best known lower bound is $c\sqrt{ k / \log k } \cdot 2^k\leq m(k)$. ^16c0c2
