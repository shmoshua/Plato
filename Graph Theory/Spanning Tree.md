> [!lemma] Theorem (Kirchoff)
> Let $G$ be a connected graph and $\mathcal{T}$ the set of all spanning trees on $G$. Let $T\in \mathcal{T}$ be uniformly at random. Then, 
> 1. for any $e,f\in E(G)$, $\mathbb{P}(e\in T,f\in T)\leq \mathbb{P}(e\in T)\mathbb{P}(f\in T)$

> [!proof]-
> By Correlation inequality.

- **Remark**: If spanning trees are generalized to spanning forests, the statement is ***Kahn's conjecture***.
