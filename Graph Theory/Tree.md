- **Related definition**: For a tree $T=(V,E)$, any vertex $v\in V$ with $d(v)=1$ is called  a ***leaf***. ^8551a4
- **Related defintion**: For a connected graph $G$, a ***spanning tree*** $T$ is a tree that is a subgraph of $G$ s.t. $V(T)=V(G)$. ^ce4662

##### Properties

> [!lemma] Lemma 1
> Let $T=(V,E)$ be a finite tree with $\left| V \right|\geq 2$. Then, 
> 1. $T$ has at least 2 leaves.
> 2. for any leaf $v\in V$, $T \backslash \{ v \}$ is also a tree.

> [!proof]-
> We have that:
> 1. Let $P$ be the longest path in tree $T$ with endpoints $u,v$. Since $P$ is the longest, $u,v$ has their neighborhood contained in $P$. However if $d(u)\geq 2$ or $d(v)\geq 2$ then we get a cycle. Hence, $d(u)=d(v)=1$ and $u,v$ are leaves. 
> 2. Let $v$ be a leaf. Then, $T \backslash \{ v \}$ still remains acyclic and connected.

> [!lemma] Theorem 2 (Equivalent Definitions of Trees)
> Let $G=(V,E)$ be a non-empty graph. TFAE:
> 1. $G$ is a tree.
> 2. $G$ is connected and $\left| E \right|=\left| V \right|-1$.
> 3. $G$ is acyclic and $\left| E \right|=\left| V \right|-1$
> 4. for all $x,y\in V$ there exists exactly one $(x,y)$-path.

> [!proof]-
> We have:
> 1. (1=>2): $G$ is connected by definition. We show by induction on $n:=\left| V \right|$.
> 	1. If $n=1$ it is obvious.
> 	1. If $n\geq 2$, then let $v\in V$ be a leaf (which exists by Lemma 1.1). Then, $G':=G \backslash \{ v \}$ is a tree as well and we have that $\left| E(G) \right|=\left| E(G') \right|+1=n-2+1=n-1$.
> 2. (2=>3): Assume that $G$ has a cycle. Then, by [[Path (Graph)|Lemma 4]], we can take an edge $e\in G$ s.t. $G \backslash e$ is connected and has $n-2$ edges. This contradicts [[Path (Graph)|Proposition 3]].
> 3. (3=>1): Let $V_{1},\dots,V_{k}$ be the connected components of $V$. Then, as each connected components are acyclic and connected, we have that, $\left| E(G[V_{i}]) \right|=\left| V_{i} \right|-1$ for all $i$. Hence, $$\left| V \right| -1=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\left| V_{i} \right| -1=\left| V \right| -k$$Hence, $k=1$. 
> 4. (1=>4): The existence of path is given by connectedness. We will show that the path is unique. Suppose there exist two paths $P,Q$ from $x$ to $y$. There must exist an edge $e=\{ u,v \}\in P$ that is not in $Q$. Further, there exists a $(u,v)$-walk that doesn't contain $e$. Hence, by [[Path (Graph)|Proposition 1]], the walk contains a $(u,v)$-path and this path doesn't contain $e$. This shows that this path forms a cycle with $e$ and this is a contradiction.
> 5. (4=>1): Connected is given by the existence of paths and if $G$ has a cycle, then there exists two paths.

> [!lemma] Corollary 3
> We have that:
> 1. any connected graph $G$ has a spanning tree.
> 2. every edge in a tree is a [[Path (Graph)|cut edge]].
> 3. adding an edge to a tree creates exactly one cycle.

^848d8c

> [!proof]-
> We have that:
> 1. If $G$ is a tree, we are done. Otherwise, there exists a cycle and we can delete any edge and by [[Path (Graph)|Lemma 4]] we still get a connected graph. As the number of edges decrease by 1 in every step, this holds.
> 2. A tree on $n$ vertices has $n-1$ edges. If we remove one edge, then we have $n-2$ edges and this cannot be connected by [[Path (Graph)|Proposition 3]].
> 3. Let $T$ be a tree and add an edge $e:=u\sim v$ that was not in $T$. Then, as there is a unique $(u,v)$-path and hence adding $e$ creates exactly one cycle.

> [!proof]-
> Fix any iteration of the outer for loop. Let $A_{1},\dots,A_{k}$ be the connected components of the forest $F$ at the beginning of the loop iteration.
> 
> Since we add a cut edge from $(V_{i},A \backslash V_{i})$ for each $i$ to $F$, we have that each formerly connected component $A_{i}$ is now connected to at least one other component $A_{j}$. Thus, the number of connected components is at most $k / 2$.
> 
> It remains to observe that removing an edge from a cycle $e\in C$ does not affect the connected components. Thus, after each for-loop iteration, the number of connected components is at least halved.
