> [!definition]
> Let $G=(V,E)$ be a [[graph]]. 
> 1. A ***walk*** is a finite sequence $W:=(v_{1},\dots,v_{k})\in V^k$ s.t. $(v_{i},v_{i+1})\in E$ for all $i$. 
> 2. The ***start/end node*** of $W$ are $v_{1}$ and $v_{k}$ respectively. 
> 3. A ***closed walk*** is a walk with the same start and end node.
- **Related Notation**: For an edge $e\in E$ and a walk $W$, $e\in W$ if $e=(v_{i},v_{i+1})$ for some $i$. The ***length*** of $W$ is given by the number of edges in $W$.
