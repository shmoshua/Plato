#Definition #LieGroups 

> [!definition]
> A ***Lie group*** is a [[topological group]] $G$ endowed with a [[Smooth Manifold|smooth manifold structure]] s.t. 
> 1. the multiplication $m:G\times G\to G$ is smooth and
> 2. the inverse $i:G\to G$ is smooth.

##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1
> A discrete group is a Lie group if and only if it is countable, in which case the dimension is $0$.

> [!proof]-
> If it is not countable, then it is not second countable.
---
> [!h] Example 2
> We have the following Lie groups:
> 1. $(\mathbb{R}^n,+)$
> 2. $(\mathbb{R}^\times,\cdot),(\mathbb{C}^\times,\cdot)$
> 3. $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ is a $n^2$ dimensional Lie group with the multiplication as polynomial and inversion as rational.
---
> [!h] Example 3
> $\text{Homeo}(X)$ is generally not a Lie group as it is not locally compact generally, but topological manifolds are.
---
> [!h] Example 4
> For a [[proper metric space]] $X$, 
> 1. $\text{Iso}(X)$ can be a Lie group but not always.
> 2. $\text{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is a Lie group w.r.t. the euclidean distance.
> 3. $\text{Iso}(M)$ is a Lie group for a [[Riemannian manifold]] $M$.
---
> [!h] Example 5
> For a Lie group $G$ and a subgroup $H\leq G$ that is also a [[regular submanifold]], 
> 1. $H$ is a Lie group with smooth structure induced by $\{ (U\cap H,\varphi|_{U\cap H}) \}$.
