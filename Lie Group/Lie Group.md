#Definition #LieGroups 

> [!definition]
> A ***Lie group*** is a [[topological group]] $G$ endowed with a [[Smooth Manifold|smooth manifold structure]] s.t. 
> 1. the multiplication $m:G\times G\to G$ is smooth and
> 2. the inverse $i:G\to G$ is smooth.

##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1
> A discrete group is a Lie group if and only if it is countable, in which case the dimension is $0$.

> [!proof]-
> If it is not countable, then it is not second countable.
---
> [!h] Example 2
> We have the following Lie groups:
> 1. $(\mathbb{R}^n,+)$
> 2. $(\mathbb{R}^\times,\cdot),(\mathbb{C}^\times,\cdot)$
