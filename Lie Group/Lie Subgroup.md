#Definition #LieGroups 

> [!definition]
> Let $G$ be a [[Lie group]]. A pair $(H,\varphi)$ is a ***Lie subgroup*** of $G$ if:
> 1. $H$ is a Lie group and
> 2. $\varphi:H\to G$ is an injective Lie group homomorphism that is also an [[Differential|immersion]].
- **Remark**: As $\varphi$ is an injective immersion, $\varphi(H)$ is an [[Submanifold|immersed submanifold]] of $G$. 
- **Remark**: Often we identify $(H,\varphi)$ with $\varphi(H)\leq G$.
