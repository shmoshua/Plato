> [!definition]
> A ***radical*** of a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is the maximal solvable ideal of $\mathfrak{g}$.

##### Properties
> [!h] Proposition 1 (Existence and Uniqueness of Radicals)
> For any Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, 
> 1. there exists a unique solvable radical $\mathfrak{z}\subseteq \mathfrak{g}$
> 2. it holds that $\mathfrak{g} / \mathfrak{z}$ is [[Semisimple Lie Algebra|semisimple]].

> [!proof]+
> The existence and uniqueness follows from [[Solvable Lie Algebra|Proposition 1.5]] and finite dimensionality. 
> 
> Now, we first show that $\mathfrak{g} / \mathfrak{z}$ has no solvable ideals.
