#Definition #LieGroups 
> [!definition]
> A [[group]] $G$ is ***topological*** if the underlying set is a [[topological space]] and the group operations are continuous, i.e.
> 1. $G\times G\to G,(g,h)\mapsto gh$ is continuous (under the product topology) and
> 2. $G\to G,g\mapsto g^{-1}$ is continuous.
- **Remark**: $g\mapsto g^{-1}$ is a [[homeomorphism]].
- **Related definition**: For any $g\in G$, the ***left/right translation*** are: $$\begin{array}{cccc} {L_{g}:}&{G}&\to&{G}\\&{x} &\mapsto & {gx} \end{array}{}\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \begin{array}{cccc} {R_{g}:}&{G}&\to&{G}\\&{x} &\mapsto & {xg} \end{array}{}$$continuous and homeomorphisms (with inverses as $L_{g^{-1}},R_{g^{-1}}$).
