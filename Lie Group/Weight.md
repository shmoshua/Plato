> Let $G$ be a [[Lie group]] and $\rho:G\to \text{GL}(V)$ be a [[Lie group representation]] to a $\mathbb{C}$-vector space $V$. A ***weight*** of $G$ in $V$ is a group homomorphism $\chi:G\to \mathbb{C}^\times$ s.t. 
> 1. $V_{\chi}:=\{ v\in V:\rho(g)v=\chi(g)v,\forall g\in G \}\neq \{ 0 \}$, in which case $V_{\chi}$ is called the ***weight space*** of $\chi$ and any non-zero element in $V_{\chi}$ is called a ***weight vector.***
