> [!definition]
> Let $A\in \text{Mat}_{n,n}(\mathbb{C})$ be [[Hermitian]], [[positive semi-definite]].
> 1. The ***Cholesky decomposition*** is given as: $$A=LL^{*}$$where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix where the diagonal entries are real and non-negative.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1 (Existence and Uniqueness of Cholesky Decomposition)
> Let $A$ be Hermitian positive semi-definite. Then,
> 1. a Cholesky decomposition exists.
> 2. if $A$ is positive definite, $L$ is unique and $L$ has positive entries on the diagonal.
> 3. if $A$ is real, $L$ is also real.
