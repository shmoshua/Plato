> [!definition] 
> Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]]. The [[Sigma Algebra|$\sigma$-algebra]] generated by all open sets of $X$ is called the ***Borel $\sigma$-algebra of $X$*** and is denoted by $\mathcal{B}(X)$. The elements of $\mathcal{B}(X)$ are called ***Borel sets***.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> Let $X=\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathcal{I}$ be the set of all half-closed intervals $[a,b)$ with $a\leq b$. Then, we have $$\sigma(\mathcal{I})=\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$$

> [!proof]-
> We have that:
> $\subseteq$: This follows from the fact that for any $[a,b)$: $$[a,b)=\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\left( a-\frac{1}{n},b \right)$$
> $\supseteq$: Firstly, we show that any open set $V$ in $\mathbb{R}$ can be represented as a countable union of open intervals. Let $(q_{k})_{k}$ be a sequence including all rational numbers in $V$ and denote by $I_{k}$ the largest open interval contained in $V$ containing $q_{k}$. Then, of course, $\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}I_{k}\subseteq V$. However, for any point $x\in V$, and $r>0$ s.t. $(x-r,x+r)\subseteq V$, and $k$ s.t. $q_{k}\in (x-r,x+r)$, we have that $(x-r,x+r)\subseteq I_{k}$ by the maximality of $I_{k}$ and therefore $x\in \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}I_{k}$. 
> 
> Now notice that any open interval can be written as: $$(a,b)=\bigcup_{n=n_{0}}^{\infty}\left[ a+\frac{1}{n},b \right)$$
> where $\frac{1}{n_{0}}<b-a$. Therefore, $V \in \sigma(\mathcal{I})$.
