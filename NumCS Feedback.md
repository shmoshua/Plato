Overall, the biggest issue that I see in the current course is how **overwhelmed** the students are. As I will write later, there are a lot of aspects about this course that confuse the students as to what the exact syllabus is and what it is that they need to know/study. There is minimal coherency in the materials: the script, lecture videos, multiple choice questions a.k.a. exercise sheets, bonus problems with **each of them introducing a new concept for the student to learn**.

##### Materials
I personally believe this has one of the biggest room for improvement:
1. **The script**: the NumCS script is currently a ~700 page pdf document that is rather an encyclopedia of information. The syllabus for this course is only a proper subset of the script and over the years and the reduction of the syllabus, only roughly half if not less of the script is actually covered in the lectures. This, in my opinion, is the biggest source of feeling overwhelmed, aggravated by the following points:
	- The lecture videos "jump" between sections of the script. It is really not clear what is part of the syllabus and what is not, especially because there are parts of the script **not covered in the lecture** even within the same sub-chapter of the script. 
	- This has led to the professor or TAs making **exercise sheets/test problems on materials not covered in the lectures**, especially if they have not watched the lecture videos thoroughly but only have seen the lecture titles and have assumed that everything in the corresponding parts in the script are covered in the lecture videos. This can be mitigated by having the professor/TA actually watch the videos or teach the course themselves.
	- The script in the parts that are covered in the lecture, **still freely refers to results from the uncovered parts**. The students in the course are left confused whether knowledge on these matters are necessary.
	- **The formatting of the script could use some improvement**. The way the current script has a very small margin and is packed with information here and there with scary colors, it is quite intimidating just from the aesthetic point of view.
2. **The coding problems**: These

##### Content
- **Regarding Linear Algebra**: The NumCS content assumes that the students have a thorough understanding of linear algebra. However, for an ordinary student, there are two challenges.
	1. NumCS happens **1 year after** they have seen linear algebra for the last time,
	2. the linear algebra knowledge expected in NumCS is **rather a thorough understanding of the theory**, whereas the linear algebra course, as far as I am concerned, is quite **calculation based**. The current linear algebra exam and exercises rather focuses on e.g. how to compute the basis of the kernel of a given linear map, which is practiced and done by plenty of students by practicing with the "Kochrezept". However, this is not sufficient to follow the NumCS lectures with ease.
- **Regarding Analysis**: This is rather minor but NumCS does introduce concepts that are introduced in Analysis II, before they are introduced in that course. I have received complaints about this, as the students were quite overwhelmed, but this diminished towards the exams, when they were properly introduced with the concepts.

##### Organization
- **Using the old lecture videos**: The videos have been receiving feedbacks for the last 3 years, during which they have been used as the main lecture material. However, there was no changes made to the videos since. Following are a few problems:
	1. The explanations in the lecture videos are not the most easy. In some topics there were parts where I had to look up in the script or internet to actually fill in the logical jumps the professor makes readily.
	2. There are indexing inconsistencies/typos/mistakes in the videos. Some of them are also present in the script. The problem is that some mistakes are updated in the script, but they are not in the old lecture videos. They might have been communicated in the previous years when they were found and corrected, but if that is not communicated every year, students are left with lecture videos and the script contradicting each other/using different notations, for reasons they cannot comprehend, causing more confusion.
	3. The videos are cut and edited to be more compact than the original version, so the pace is quite faster than a normal lecture recording. This hinders to student to actually think with and follow the lecturer.
- **Flipped Classroom Format**: This allows the students to really easily slack off and lose track of the course. Because everyone is supposed to watch the video at home in the time of their own preference, although this provides great flexibility for the students, but also this can be easily put off. This naturally leads to students not going to QnA sessions, especially because it also does not feel comfortable asking the professor about a lecture content that was "presented" a couple of weeks ago. I think a classroom where the students can follow the lecturer as they explain and can ask questions at the spot if ther
