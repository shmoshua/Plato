Overall, the biggest issue that I see in the current course is how **overwhelmed** the students are. As I will write later, there are a lot of aspects about this course that confuse the students as to what the exact syllabus is and what it is that they need to know/study.

##### Content
- **Regarding Linear Algebra**: The NumCS content assumes that the students have a thorough understanding of linear algebra. However, for an ordinary student, there are two challenges.
	1. NumCS happens **1 year after** they have seen linear algebra for the last time,
	2. the linear algebra knowledge expected in NumCS is **rather a thorough understanding of the theory**, whereas the linear algebra course, as far as I am concerned, is quite **calculation based**. The current linear algebra exam and exercises rather focuses on e.g. how to compute the basis of the kernel of a given linear map, which is practiced and done by plenty of students by practicing with the "Kochrezept". However, this is not sufficient to follow the NumCS lectures with ease.
