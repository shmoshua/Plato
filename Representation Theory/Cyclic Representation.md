> [!definition]
> Let $V\neq 0$ be a [[representation]] of an [[associative algebra]] $A$. Then, a vector $v\in V$ is ***cyclic*** if $Av=V$. $V$ is ***cyclic*** if it admits a cyclic vector.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Proposition 1
> Let $V\neq 0$ be a representation of $A$. 
> 1. $V$ is irreducible if and only if all non-zero vectors of $V$ are cyclic.
> 2. $V$ is cyclic if and only if it is isomorphic to $A / I$ where $I$ is a [[Ideal|left ideal]] in $A$.

> [!proof]+
> We have:
> 1. Let $0\neq v\in V$ be a not cyclic. Then

##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1
> Give an example of an indecomposable representation which is not cyclic.
