> [!definition]
> For a representation $V$ of $A$, the ***dual representation*** $V^{*}$ is a right $A$-module s.t. $$(fa)(v)=f(av)$$

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> Let $A:=\bigoplus_{i=1}^r\text{M}_{d_{i}}(K)$. Then, the irreducible representations of $A$ are $V_{1}:=K^{d_{1}},\dots,V_{r}:=K^{d_{r}}$ and any finite-dimensional representation of $A$ is a direct sum of copies of $V_{1},\dots,V_{r}$.
