> For a [[quiver]] $Q$, the ***path algebra*** $P_{Q}$ of $Q$ is an algebra, whose basis is formed by oriented paths in $Q$, including the trivial paths $\{ p_{i} \}_{i\in I}$. The multiplication of $a,b\in P_{Q}$ is defined as concatenation $ab$ obtained by first tracing $b$, then $a$. If this is not possible, $ab=0$.
- **Remark**: If $Q$ is finite, for all $a\in P_{Q}, $
