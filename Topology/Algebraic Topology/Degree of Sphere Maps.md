##### Properties
> [!lemma] Proposition 1
> For all $f:S^n\to S^n$ continuous and homology theory $H$ with coefficients $\mathbb{Z}$, 
> 1. $\deg(f)$ is well-defined.
> 2. $\deg(\text{id})=1$.
> 3. $\deg(g \circ f)=\deg(g)\deg(f)$
> 4. if $f\sim g$ are [[Homotopy|homotopic]], then $\deg(f)=\deg(g)$.
> 5. $\deg(c)=0$ for any constant function $c$.

> [!proof]+
> We have that:
> 1. Recall that from [[Homology Theory|Example 1]], $\tilde{H}_{n}(S^n)\cong \mathbb{Z}$.  Let $\tau:\mathbb{Z} \to \tilde{H}_{n}(S^n)$ be an isomorphism. Then, we have that: $$\begin{CD}\mathbb{Z}@>\varphi>> \mathbb{Z}\\@V\tau VV@V\tau VV\\\tilde{H}_{n}(S^n)@>>f_{*}> \tilde{H}_{n}(S^n) \end{CD}$$commutes. However, we have that $\varphi(i):= d \cdot i$ for some $d$. Hence, we have that: $$f_{*}(a)=\tau(d(\tau ^{-1}(a)))=d \cdot  a$$
> 2. We have that: $f_{*}=\text{id}_{\tilde{H}_{n}(S^n)}$.
> 3. $(g\circ f)_{*}(a)=g_{*}(f_{*}(a))=\deg(g)\deg(f)a$.
