> [!definition]
> Let $\mathcal{C}:=\{ C_{p} \}_{p\in \mathbb{Z}}$ be a [[graded abelian group]] s.t. $C_{p}$ is [[Finitely Generated Abelian Group|finitely generated]] for all $p\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $C_{p}\neq 0$ for finitely many $p$'s.
> 1. The ***Euler characteristic*** of $\mathcal{C}$ is defined as: $$\chi(\mathcal{C}):=\sum_{p\in \mathbb{Z}}^{}(-1)^p\text{rank}(C_{p})\in \mathbb{Z}$$

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a chain complex of bounded finite type, i.e. for all $p\in \mathbb{Z}$, $C_{p}$ is finitely generated for all $p\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $C_{p}\neq 0$ for finitely many $p$'s. Then, 
> 1. $\chi(\mathcal{C})=\chi(H_{*}(\mathcal{C}))$

> [!proof]+
> Let $Z_{i}\subseteq C_{i}$ be the subgroup of cycles and $B_{i}\subseteq Z_{i}$, the subgroup of boundaries. Then, $$ 0\to B_{i}\hookrightarrow. $$
