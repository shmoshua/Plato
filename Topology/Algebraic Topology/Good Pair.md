> [!definition]
> A pair of [[Topological Space|topological spaces]] $(X,A)$ is ***good*** if:
> 1. $\varnothing\neq A\subseteq X$ and $A$ is closed in $X$ s.t.
> 2. there exists $A\subseteq N\subseteq X$ s.t. $A$ is a [[Retract|strong deformation retract]] of $N$.

##### Examples

> We have that:
> 1. A [[CW-complex]] $X$ and a subcomplex $A$ builds a good pair.
