#Definition #Topology 

> [!definition]
> Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. 
> 1. A subcollection $\mathcal{B}\subseteq \mathcal{T}$ is called the ***base/basis of topology***, if every open set is a union of sets from $\mathcal{ B}$.
> 2. A subcollection $\mathcal{G}\subseteq \mathcal{T}$  is called the ***subbase of topology***, if every open set is a union of finite intersections of sets from $\mathcal{ G}$.

##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1
> $\mathbb{R}$ with the euclidean topology has the bases:
> 1. $\{ (x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon)|x\in \mathbb{R},\varepsilon>0 \}$.
> 2. $\{ (a,b):a<b \}$
> 3. $\{ (a,b) :a<b,a,b\in \mathbb{Q}\}$ is a countable basis.
