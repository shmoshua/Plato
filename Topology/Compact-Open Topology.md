> Let $X,Y$ be [[Topological Space|topological spaces]]. The ***compact-open topology*** on $C(X,Y)$ is a topology that has $$S(K,U):=\{ f\in C(X,Y):f(K)\subseteq U \}$$where $K\subseteq X$ compact and $U\subseteq Y$ open as a sub-basis, i.e. the finite intersections of these form the basis of the topology.
