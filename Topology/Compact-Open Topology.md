> [!definition]
> Let $X,Y$ be [[Topological Space|topological spaces]]. The ***compact-open topology*** on $C(X,Y)$ is a topology that has $$S(K,U):=\{ f\in C(X,Y):f(K)\subseteq U \}$$where $K\subseteq X$ compact and $U\subseteq Y$ open as a sub-basis, i.e. the finite intersections of these form the basis of the topology.

> Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]]. Then, the compact-open topology on $C(X)$ is equivalent to the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of $X$.
