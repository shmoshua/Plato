> A [[topological space]] $X$ is ***connected*** if one of the following equivalent conditions hold:
> 1. For all topological spaces $X_{1},X_{2}$ s.t. $X$ is homeomorphic to $X_{1}\sqcup X_{2}$, then: $$X_{1}=\varnothing\lor X_{2}=\varnothing$$
> 2. For all pair of disjoint open sets $U_{1},U_{2}\subseteq X$, if $U_{1}\cup U_{2}=X$ then,$$U_{1}=\varnothing\lor U_{2}=\varnothing$$
> 3. The only sets that are both open and closed are $\varnothing$ and $X$.
