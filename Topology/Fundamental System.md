> [!definition]
> Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $x_{0}\in X$. A ***fundamental system of (open) neighborhoods*** of $x_{0}$ is a set $\mathcal{V}$ of (open) neighborhoods of $x_{0}$ s.t. 
> 1. for every neighborhood $V$ of $x_{0}$, there exists $W\in \mathcal{V}$ with $W\subseteq V$.

> For a metric space $(X,d)$, $\{ B_{<r}(x):r>0 \}$ is a fundamental system of open neighborhood of $x$.
