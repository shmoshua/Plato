> [!definition]
> Let $X,Y$ be [[Topological Space|topological spaces]]. A map $f:X\to Y$ is called a ***homeomorphism***, if:
> 1. $f$ is bijective and
> 2. $f,f^{-1}$ are [[Continuous Function|continuous]].

##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1 (Homeomorphism between Rn)
> We have that:
> 1. $\mathbb{R}^0$ is not homeomorphic to any other $\mathbb{R}^n$, as it is finite. 
> 2. $\mathbb{R}$ is not homeomorphic to any other $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 2$: For any $x\in \mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R} \backslash \{ x \}$ is not connected whereas $\mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{ y \}$ is.
> 3. $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not homeomorphic to any other $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 3$: For any $x\in \mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R} \backslash \{ x \}$ is not contractible whereas $\mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{ y \}$ is.
