> [!definition]
> A [[topological space]] $(X,\mathcal{O})$ is ***locally compact***, if every $x\in X$ has a neighborhood with compact [[closure]].

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Proposition 1
> For $(X,\mathcal{O})$ locally compact, every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains a neighborhood of $x$ of compact closure.

> [!proof]-
> Let $V$ be the neighborhood of $x$ with compact closure. Then, $U\cap V\subseteq U$ and $\overline{U\cap V}\subseteq \overline{V}$ which is compact.
