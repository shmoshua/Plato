> [!definition]
> A [[topological space]] $X$ is ***locally compact***, if every $x\in X$ has a [[Compact sets|compact]] neighborhood, i.e. there exists an open set $U$ and a compact set $K$ s.t. $x\in U\subseteq K$.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Proposition 1
> For a locally compact topological space $X$, every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains a compact neighborhood.

> [!proof]+
> Let $K$ be the compact neighborhood of $x$. Then, $U\cap K$
> Then, $U\cap V\subseteq U$ and $\overline{U\cap V}\subseteq \overline{V}$ which is compact.
