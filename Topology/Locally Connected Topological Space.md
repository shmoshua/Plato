> A [[topological space]] $X$ is locally connected, if for all $x\in X$

 topological space is said to be **locally connected** at _x_ (where _x_ is a [point](https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Point_(geometry)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Point (geometry) (does not exist)") of the space to be called _X_), if for each [neighbourhood](https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Neighbourhood_(mathematics)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Neighbourhood (mathematics) (does not exist)") _V_ of _x_, there is a [connected](https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Connected_(topology)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Connected (topology) (does not exist)") neighbourhood _U_ of _x_ contained in _V_.
