> [!h] Example 1
> An affine [[variety]] $X$ is a Noetherian space.

> [!proof]-
> Let $X$ be an affine variety and let there be an infinite strictly decreasing chain of affine subvarieties: $$X_{0}\supsetneq X_{1}\supsetneq X_{2}\supsetneq\dots$$This induces an increasing chain: $$I(X_{0})\subsetneq I(X_{1})\subsetneq \dots$$which cannot exist as $A(X)$ is [[Noetherian and Artinian Module|Noetherian]].
