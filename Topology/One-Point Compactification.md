> [!definition]
> Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. The ***one-point compactification*** of $X$ is the topological space $\alpha X$ where:
> 1. $\alpha X:=X\cup \{ \infty \}$ and
> 2. For any $U$ open in $X$, $U$ is open in $\alpha X$.
> 3. For any $K$ closed and compact in $X$, $(X \backslash K)\cup \{ \infty \}$ is open in $\alpha X$.
- **Remark**: if $X$ is Hausdorff, then condition 3 only requires compactness.
