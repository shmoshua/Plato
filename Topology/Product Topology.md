#Definition #Topology 

> [!definition]
> For any family $\{ X_{i} \}_{i\in I}$ of [[Topological Space|topological spaces]], $X:=\prod_{i\in I}^{}X_{i}$ is endowed with a ***product topology***, which is the [[initial topology]] of the projections $\pi_{i}:X\to X_{i}$. 
- **Remark**: By [[Initial Topology|Lemma 2]], for any topological space $Y$, a map $f:Y\to X$ is continuous if and only if $\pi_{i}\circ f:Y\to X_{i}$ is continuous for all $i\in I$.

##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1
> $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the euclidean topology coincides with the product topology from $\mathbb{R}$ with the euclidean topology.
---
> [!h] Example 2
> The [[Cantor space]] $C$ has the topology equivalent to the product topology of $\{ 0,1 \}^\infty$ with the discrete topology on each.
---
> [!h] Example 3
> For a set $A$, consider the space of all functions $\mathcal{F}(A,\mathbb{C})$. Then, the space of pointwise convergence coincides with the product topology on $\prod_{a\in A}\mathbb{C}$.
