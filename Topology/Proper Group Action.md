> [!definition]
> Let $G$ be a [[topological group]] acting continuously on a [[topological space]] $X$.
> 1. The [[group action]] is called ***proper*** if: $$\rho:G\times X\to X\times X,\quad (g,x)\mapsto (x,gx)$$is a [[proper map]].

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> Let $G\curvearrowright X$ be a proper group action. Then,
> 1. $X / G$ is Hausdorff.
> 2. $Gx\in X / G$ is closed in $X$.
> 3. $\text{St}_{G}(x)$ is compact for all $x\in X$.
> 4. $G / \text{St}_{G}(x) \to Gx$ is a homeomorphism.
> 5. if $G$ is Hausdorff, then so is $X$.
