> [!definition]
> A [[Topological Space|topological space]] is ***separable*** if it contains a countable, [[Dense Subset|dense subset]], i.e. there exists a sequence $\{ x_{i} \}_{i\geq 1}$ of elements of the space such that every nonempty open subsets of the space contains at least one element of the sequence.

##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1
> We have:
> 1. $\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{C}^n$ is separable.
---
> [!h] Example 2
> Every [[compact metric space]] is separable.

> [!proof]-
> Let $X$ be compact metric. Then, $X$ is totally bounded and let $X_{\varepsilon}$ define the $\varepsilon$-net for $\varepsilon>0$. Therefore, $Y:=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}X_{1 / n}$ is a countable dense subset.
