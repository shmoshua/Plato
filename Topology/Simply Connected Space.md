> [!definition]
> A [[topological space]] $X$ is ***simply connected*** if it is [[Path-Connected Space|path-connected]] and $\pi_{1}(X,x)$ is trivial for some $x\in X$. 
- **Remark**: From path-connectedness, all [[Fundamental Group|fundamental groups]] $\pi_{1}(X,x)$ are isomorphic. So the definition implies that the fundamental group is trivial at every point.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Theorem 1
> Let $Y$ be a simply connected space and $G$ a [[Topological Group|discrete group]] s.t. the projection $p:Y\to Y /G=:X$ is a [[covering space]]. Then,
> 1. for all $\overline{x_{0}}\in X$, $\pi_{1}(X,\overline{x_{0}})\cong G$.

##### Examples
> [!h] Example 1
> From [[Covering Space|Example 1]] $p:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R} /\mathbb{Z}$ is a covering space. Further, $\mathbb{R}$ is simply connected as it is contractible. Therefore, 
> 1. $\pi_{1}(\mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Z},0)\cong \mathbb{Z}$ by Theorem 1.
> 2. $\pi_{1}(S^1, 1)\cong \mathbb{Z}$ by [[Fundamental Group|Corollary of Proposition 2]].
