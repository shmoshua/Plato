> A pointed space $(X,x_{0})$ is ***nice*** if $x_{0}\in X$ has a closed neighborhood $N$ where $x_{0}$ is a [[Retract|strong deformation retract]] in $N$. Let $(X,x_{0}),(Y,y_{0})$ be nice LCH spaces. Then, 
> 1. the ***smash product*** of $X,Y$ is defined as a pointed space $(X\land Y,*)$ $$X\land Y:=X\times Y / X\lor Y$$where $q(X\lor Y)=\{ * \}$.
