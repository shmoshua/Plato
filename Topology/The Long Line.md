> [!definition]
> Let $I$ be a totally-ordered, well-ordered uncountable set with the property that for any $a\in I$, the set $\{ i\in I:i\leq a \}$ is countable. Then, 
> 1. the ***long ray*** is given as: $$L:=\bigsqcup_{i\in I}^{}[0,1)$$
> 2. the ***long line*** is given by glueing two long rays together.

##### Properties
> [!lemma] Proposition 1 (Existence of I)
> There exists a totally-ordered, well-ordered set $I$ that is not countable, s.t. 
> 1. for any $a\in I$, the set $\{ i\in I:i\leq a \}$ is countable. 

> [!proof]+
> By Zermelo's theorem, $\mathbb{R}$ can be given a well-ord
